## Requirements

* **[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)** (current LTS version)
* **[DADI API](https://github.com/dadi/api)** (version 4.4.3)

## Setting up

The easiest way to install Publish is using DADI CLI. CLI is a command line application that can be used to create and maintain installations of DADI products.

There are two ways to create a new Publish installation with the CLI: either manually create a new directory for Publish or let CLI handle that for you. DADI CLI accepts an argument for `project-name` which it uses to create a directory for the installation.

*Manual directory creation*

```console
$ mkdir my-publish
$ cd my-publish
$ npx dadi-cli publish new
```

*Automatic directory creation*

```console
$ npx dadi-cli publish new my-publish
$ cd my-publish
```

DADI CLI will install the latest version of Publish and copy a set of files to your chosen directory so you can launch Publish immediately.

> **Installing DADI Publish directly from NPM**
>
> All DADI platform microservices are also available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). To add *Publish* to an existing project as a dependency:
>
> ```console
> $ cd my-existing-node-app
> $ npm install --save @dadi/publish
> ```
> -- advice

## Application anatomy

When CLI finishes creating your Publish installation, the application directory will contain the basic requirements for launching Publish. The following directories and files have been created for you:

```console
my-publish/
  config/              # contains environment-specific configuration files
    config.development.json
  server.js            # the entry point for the application
  package.json
```

## Configuration

Publish reads a series of configuration parameters to define its behaviour and to adapt to each environment it runs in. These parameters are defined in JSON files placed inside the `config/` directory, named as `config.{ENVIRONMENT}.json`, where `{ENVIRONMENT}` is the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. In practice, this allows you to have different configuration parameters for when Publish is running in development, production and any staging, QA or anything in between, as per the requirements of your development workflow.

Some configuration parameters also have corresponding environment variables, which will override whatever value is set in the configuration file.

The following table shows a list of all the available configuration parameters.

| Path | Description | Environment variable | Default | Format

## Launching the application

After configuring the application, you can start the Publish server by entering its directory and running `npm start`. You should see in the console a message similar to the one below, confirming that the application is now running and telling you what is the host and port you should use to access it.

```

To access the application, open the URL above in your browser.

## Adding an API

If you access the application without configuring an API, you'll see an error message telling you that your instance of Publish hasn't been configured. To fix that, [create a new API](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api/4.4#creating-an-api) if you don't have one already and add its details (host and port) to the `apis` block of your Publish configuration file.

```json
{
  "apis": [
    {
      "host": "https://api.somedomain.tech",
      "port": 443
    }
  ]
}
```

After doing so, restart the application and the error message should be gone.

To sign in, you must have a username and password, which you can obtain by [creating an API client](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#authentication) if you don't have one already. If you do, type the client's ID and secret into the username and password fields to authenticate with Publish.

## Configuring an API

### Navigation menu

Publish displays a navigation menu containing the collections returned from the connected API. By default, the navigation items are in the order received from the API. 

The configuration file allows a `menu` property that can be used to customise the navigation menu in two ways:

1. by modifiying the order of items, and
1. by creating menu groups to keep related collections together.

The following `menu` configuration is used to render the navigation menu as shown below. Notice that any collections not specified in the `menu` configuration are displayed in alphabetical order after the explicitly configured menu items.

```json
"menu": [
  {
    "title": "Content",
    "collections": [
      "pages",
      "team"
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "Taxonomy",
    "collections": [
      "categories",
      "sub-categories",
      "milestones"
    ]
  }
]
```

![Menu](/assets/publish/menu.png)

### Extending collection settings

Publish has been designed in such a way that it can connect to an existing instance of DADI API and work right out of the box, without requiring any additional configuration. Optionally, it can use a variety of extended field values to enhance the user interface and aid with document operations. These fields are defined in an optional `publish` object that can be added to the `settings` block of any collection schema.

The following table shows a list of available properties.

| Property   | Description   | Example  | Default |
|------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| `hidden`  | Hides a collection from the navigation menu  | `true`  | `false`    |

By default, the navigation menu will display all collections that the user has access to. If you need to hide a specific collection from the menu, add a `publish.hidden` property to the collection's `settings` block.

In the below example, the `publish` block in the collection settings instructs Publish to hide this particular collection from the navigation menu.

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "publish": {
      "hidden": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extending field settings

Similarly to [extending collection settings](#extending-collection-settings), it's also possible to extend the functionality of individual fields in a collection schema. This can be done by adding an optional `publish` block to the object that defines a field within the collection schema.

The following table shows a list of available properties.


| Property   | Description   | Example  | Default |
|------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| `section`  | The tabbed section this field should be displayed in  | `"Details"`  | `"General"`    |
| `placement` | The location of the field within the document view, options are `"main"` and `"sidebar"`  | `"main"` | `"sidebar"`    |
| `display.list` | If `true`, the field is displayed in the document list view | `true` | `true`  |
| `display.edit` | If `true`, the field is displayed in the document edit view | `true` | `true`  |
| `readonly`  | If `true`, the field is not editable in the document edit view | `true` | `false` |
| `multiline` | If `true`, String fields are rendered with a multiline textarea rather than a text input | `true`                | `false` |
| `options`   | Limits the content of the field to a fixed set of values. It's defined as an array of objects containing `value` and `label` properties. When used with the String field, a dropdown is rendered | `[{"value": "uk", "label": "United Kingdom"}]`                | N/A |
| `multiple`  | Defines whether the field allows multiple values. When used with the String field and `options` is defined, a multi-select dropdown is rendered | `true`                | `false` |
| `limit`     | Defines the maximum number of values allowed in the field. Overrides `multiple`            | `10`                  | `1`     |
| `subType`         | Defines an optional subType for the field.  | `Image`               |  None   |

In the below example, the `publish` block for the `title` field instructs Publish to:
 * display the field in a tabbed section called "General"
 * display the field in the "main" panel of the interface
 * display the value of the field in the document list view
 * allow the field to be edited in the document edit view

```json
"fields": {
  "title": {
    "type": "String",
    "label": "Title",
    "required": true,
    "publish": {
      "section": "General",
      "placement": "main",
      "display": {
        "list": true,
        "edit": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Listing documents

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot here? -->

Clicking on a collection on the [navigation menu](#navigation-menu) leads to the *document list view*, where it's possible to browse all the documents within a collection.

A table will display all the documents in the collection, with a column for each field and a row for each document. Clicking on the first field of a row takes users to [the edit view](#editing-documents), where it's possible to view and edit the corresponding document.

![Document list](/assets/publish/document-list.png)

### Showing and hiding fields

By default, all fields in the collection (that the user has [access to](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#advanced-permissions-for-collection-resources)) will be shown in the table, sorted by their order of appearance in the collection schema. When the collection has a large number of fields, this may not be desirable.

For that reason, it's possible to specify which fields are shown in this view by annotating the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings). To hide a particular field, set `publish.display.list` to `false` in its configuration block.

```json
"fields": {
  "notInteresting": {
    "type": "String",
    "publish": {
      "display": {
        "list": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that setting this property to `false` acts as a *blacklist*: except for the ones explicitly excluded, all fields will be displayed, even the ones without a `display.list` property or a `publish` block.

Conversely, when **at least one** of the fields has this property set to `true`, the logic is reversed and the principle of a *whitelist* applies, meaning that only fields with `display.list` explicitly set to `true` will be shown.

### Pagination

Publish automatically separates documents into pages and includes controls on the bottom toolbar to navigate between them: you can click on *Prev* or *Next* to go to the previous or next page, click on a specific page number or type the page number on the *Go to page* input.

The number of documents that are shown for each page is determined by API, not Publish. It can configured by changing the `count` property in the [collection settings](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#collection-settings).

### Sorting

It's possible to sort documents by any field shown in the table by clicking on the corresponding table header. Once a field has been selected, it's possible to change the sort order (ascending or descending) by clicking on the same header.

### Bulk actions

Each row shows a checkbox on the leftmost part of the row. This can be used to make a selection of documents and perform actions on them as a group. When a selection is made, the dropdown labelled as *With selected* on the bottom toolbar will be unlocked, showing all the bulk actions available.

After selecting one, clicking the *Apply* button confirms the operation.

### Filtering

Publish offers a selection of filters that makes it possible to search for specific documents in the collection, or define a list of criteria for narrowing down the document set displayed.

The quickest way to add a filter is to use the search bar on the top-left corner of the screen, labelled with *Search [collection name]*. As you type, a dropdown will allow you to quickly select the field to search in. Only fields of type `String` will be shown in this view.

![Search](/assets/publish/filters-search.png)

To filter by fields of other types, or to add more complex filters including operators like *does not equal* or a literal match, click the *Add filter* button on the top-right corner.

The currently applied filters will be shown next to the search bar. Click on an individual filter to edit it, or hit *X* to remove it.

## Editing documents

Clicking on a document in the [document list view](#listing-documents) leads to the *document edit view*, where it's possible to view the full content of a document as well as make changes to it.

### Showing and hiding fields

By default, all fields in the collection (that the user has [access to](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#advanced-permissions-for-collection-resources)) will be shown in the editing interface, but it's possible to change this behaviour by annotating the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings). To hide a particular field, set `publish.display.edit` to `false` in its configuration block.

```json
"fields": {
  "notInteresting": {
    "type": "String",
    "publish": {
      "display": {
        "edit": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that setting this property to `false` acts as a *blacklist*: except for the ones explicitly excluded, all fields will be displayed, even the ones without a `display.edit` property or a `publish` block.

Conversely, when **at least one** of the fields has this property set to `true`, the logic is reversed and the principle of a *whitelist* applies, meaning that only fields with `display.edit` explicitly set to `true` will be shown.

### Organising fields into sections

To avoid a cluttered interface when a collection has a large number of fields and to make fields easier to find, it's possible to group fields into tabbed sections by annotating the field with a `section` property within the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings). Each section will appear as a tab at the top of the document edit view.

The example below places the *title* field in a section called *Details* and the *isbn* field in a section called *Meta*.

```json
"title": {
  "publish": {
    "section": "Details"
  }
},
"isbn": {
  "publish": {
    "section": "Meta"
  }
}
```

![Section property](/assets/publish/document-edit-section.png "Section")

If no fields have an assigned section, no tabs will be shown and all fields will be grouped together in a single page. If at least one field has an assigned section, any fields without a section will be placed in a section called *Other*.

### Changing field placement

Another level of customisation for the editing interface is the ability to control which part of the editing interface a field appears in. With the `placement` property within the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings), it's possible to place fields in the main column, by setting the property to `"main"`, or in the sidebar, with the value `"sidebar"`.

The main column takes up two thirds of the horizontal space, whilst the sidebar fills up the remaining third.

```json
"title": {
  "publish": {
    "section": "Details",
    "placement": "main"
  }
},
"slug": {
  "publish": {
    "section": "Details",
    "placement": "sidebar"
  }
}
```

![Placement property](/assets/publish/document-edit-placement.png "Placement")

When a `placement` property isn't defined, fields will be placed in the main column.

### Field labels

Each field is identified by a label placed on the top-left corner of its container. By default, this is populated by the name of the field as it is defined in the collection schema, which is usually not an optimal value since this value was designed as a machine-friendly *slug* (e.g. it cannot contain spaces or non-alphanumeric characters).

It's possible to customise this name by specifying a `label` property in the field definition block.

```json
"jobDescription": {
  "type": "String",
  "label": "Job Description"
}
```

![Field label](/assets/publish/field-label.png)

### Field comments

In situations where it may not be obvious what the field should contain, or what format the input is expected to be in, it's possible to define a comment that will be displayed on the top-right corner of the field. This can be done by adding a `comment` property to the field definition block.

```json
"jobDescription": {
  "type": "String",
  "label": "Job Description",
  "comment": "What does the person do?"
}
```

![Field comment](/assets/publish/field-comment.png)

### Validation

Publish will validate fields as per the [validation rules](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#validating-data) defined in the collection schema. These rules can be as simple as marking a field as required, or specifying a strict pattern that values must comply with, such as an email address.

When a field is failing the validation rules, its background changes to a light red and a message is shown indicating what the error is. If the field is part of a tabbed section, a warning icon will appear next to the tab.

![Field validation](/assets/publish/field-validation.png)

The interface will not let users save the document until all validation errors are corrected.

### Read-only fields

A collection might have fields whose value is generated by a third-party application or even by API itself – for example, a [hook](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#hooks) that generates a URL-friendly slug from a human-friendly title. In these cases, it's useful to show this field in the editing interface, but not allow editors to change its value.

This is possible with the `readonly` property in the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings).

```json
"slug": {
  "type": "String",
  "publish": {
    "readonly": true
  }
}
```

![Read-only fields](/assets/publish/field-read-only.png)

## Creating documents

To create a new document, select the collection using the [navigation menu](#navigation-menu) and click on the *Create new* button on the top-right corner. You'll be taken to the same editing interface described in [Editing documents](#editing-documents).

## Enhanced fields

Publish knows how to render most of the primitive field types supported by DADI API. *String* fields will be rendered as text inputs, *Boolean* as checkboxes, etc. Whilst these should be enough to cover most situations, other components are included with the application, offering editors more optimal ways of controlling certain field types.

### Colour

When a colour is stored as a hexadecimal code in a `String` field, it's possible to render a colour picker with a palette and hue selectors, as well as a small colour swatch next to the field value.

To enable it, define a `subType` property with the value of `"Color"` within the [field settings block](#extending-field-settings).

```json
"color": {
  "type": "String",
  "label": "Colour",
  "publish": {
    "subType": "Color"
  }
}
```

![Colour field](/assets/publish/field-colour.png)

### Images

The recommended way of referencing an image is by using a [field of type *Media*](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#referencing-media-from-another-collection), in which case Publish automatically renders a component that allows users to select any item from the [media library](#media-library), or upload new images using *drag and drop* or the operating system's file selector.

![Image field](/assets/publish/field-image.png)

For backwards-compatibility, it's also possible to render the same interface when using a *Reference* field, by providing a `subType` property with the value of `"Media"`.

```json
"image": {
  "type": "Reference",
  "settings": {
    "collection": "mediaStore"
  },
  "publish": {
    "subType": "Media"
  }
}
```

### Rich editor

A *String* field can declare what format it expects its input to be in (e.g. plain text, HTML, Markdown, etc.), using the `format` property in the field definition block. For some of these formats (currently limited to Markdown), Publish can offer a rich editor with formatting controls.

```json
"body": {
  "type": "String",
  "label": "Body",
  "format": "markdown"
}
```

![Rich editor](/assets/publish/field-rich-editor.png)

## Media library

Publish seamlessly integrates with DADI API's [support for media files](https://docs.dadi.cloud/api#working-with-files) and provides a set of views that allow you view, edit and create new media items.

### Listing media items

In addition to all configured collections, the [navigation menu](#navigation-menu) contains a link to the *Media Library*. In there, a grid view shows all the available media items. Similarly to the [document list view](#listing-documents), clicking on an individual item leads to the editing interface and selecting multiple items allows you to perform bulk actions on them.

It's also possible to add new items to the media library straight from this view, by dragging an item onto the drop area at the top of the grid or clicking the *Select files* to launch the operating system's file explorer.

![Media list view](/assets/publish/media-list-view.jpg)

### Editing media items

Clicking on an individual media item brings up the media editing interface, which has a similar layout to the [document editing interface](#editing-documents). A preview of the file is shown, if one can be rendered, and some metadata that is automatically added by API is shown on the sidebar, such as the MIME type, file size and URL.

This interface also includes some additional metadata fields that can be edited, such as caption, *alt text* or copyright information.

![Media edit view](/assets/publish/media-edit-view.jpg)
