## Installation

The easiest way to install CDN is using DADI CLI. CLI is a command line application that can be used to create and maintain installations of DADI products. Follow the simple instructions below, or see [more detailed documentation for DADI CLI](/cli).

### Install DADI CLI

```console
$ npm install @dadi/cli -g
```

### Create new CDN installation

There are two ways to create a new CDN with the CLI: either manually create a new directory for CDN or let CLI handle that for you. DADI CLI accepts an argument for `project-name` which it uses to create a directory for the installation.

*Manual directory creation*

```console
$ mkdir my-cdn
$ cd my-cdn
$ dadi cdn new
```

*Automatic directory creation*

```console
$ dadi cdn new my-cdn
$ cd my-cdn
```

DADI CLI will install the latest version of CDN and copy a set of files to your chosen directory so you can launch CDN almost immediately.

> **Installing DADI CDN directly from NPM**
>
> All DADI platform microservices are also available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). To add *CDN* to an existing project as a dependency:
> ```console
> $ cd my-existing-node-app
> $ npm install --save @dadi/cdn
> ```
> -- advice

### Forever (optional)

As with most Node.js applications, to run the app in the background you will need to install install [Forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) and [Forever-service](https://github.com/zapty/forever-service):

``` console
$ [sudo] npm install forever -g
$ [sudo] npm install -g forever-service
```

Install DADI CDN as a service and ensure it loads on boot:

``` console
$ [sudo] forever-service install -s main.js -e NODE_ENV=production cdn --start
```

**Note** the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` must be set to target the required config version.

You can then interact with the service using the following command:

``` console
$ [sudo] service cdn start
$ [sudo] service cdn stop
$ [sudo] service cdn status 
$ [sudo] service cdn restart
```

## Configuration

All the core platform services are configured using environment specific configuration files, the default being `development`. For more advanced users this can also load based on the `hostname` i.e., it will also look for `config." + req.headers.host + ".json`

A very basic `config.development.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3001
  },
  "images": {
    "directory": {
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "./path-to-images"
    }
  }
}
```

      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## Defining sources

Before you can serve assets or images you need to tell CDN where your files are located. CDN can serve your files from three types of source:

* [Amazon S3](#amazon-s3) - retrieve files from existing Amazon S3 buckets
* [Remote server](#remote-server) - retrieve files from a remote web server
* [Local filesystem](#local-filesystem) - retrieve files from the same server as CDN

You’re not limited to choosing one source, either. If you’ve elected to use the [Querystring URL Scheme](#querystring-url-scheme) then you can use all configured sources at the same time.

> **Using the legacy path scheme**
> 
> If you're _not_ using the [Querystring URL Scheme](#querystring-url-scheme), that is, you're using the legacy [Path URL Scheme](#path-url-scheme), then *only one source* can be configured at a time.
> -- advice

## Configuring sources

### [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

> **Security Note**
> 
> We **strongly** recommend creating an Amazon IAM account specifically for accessing your S3 buckets.
> -- warning

#### Using the configuration file

The [configuration file](#configuration) contains two sections for configuring an Amazon S3 source. One section is for images and the other is for assets. Specifying image and asset settings separately allows you to use different Amazon credentials for each one.

> **Security Note:** We **strongly** recommend that Amazon credentials **are not** stored in your configuration file if that file could be viewed by the public (for example, committed to a public GitHub repository). A better solution is to use [Environment Variables](#using-environment-variables) when configuring an Amazon S3 source.

**Configuration for an Amazon S3 image source**
```js
"images": {
  "s3": {
    "enabled": true,
    "accessKey": "your-access-key",
    "secretKey": "your-secret",
    "bucketName": "your-bucket",
    "region": "your-region"
  }
}
```

**Configuration for an Amazon S3 asset source**
```js
"assets": {
  "s3": {
    "enabled": true,
    "accessKey": "your-access-key",
    "secretKey": "your-secret",
    "bucketName": "your-bucket",
    "region": "your-region"
  }
}
```

> Setting the `enabled` property is essential only when you're using the legacy Path URL scheme. In that case, only one of the source types can be configured for use at any one time, by setting it's `enabled` property to `true`.

**A full Amazon S3 image source configuration, using the Path URL scheme**
```js
"images": {
  "s3": {
    "enabled": true,
    "accessKey": "your-access-key",
    "secretKey": "your-secret",
    "bucketName": "your-bucket",
    "region": "your-region"
  },
  "remote": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "directory": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

It was mentioned earlier that if using the [Querystring URL Scheme](#querystring-url-scheme) then you can use all configured sources at the same time, regardless of the value of the `enabled` property.

##### Using environment variables

One easy way to set environment variables is to specify them on the command line when you launch CDN:

```
$ AWS_S3_IMAGES_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key AWS_S3_IMAGES_SECRET_KEY=your-secret node main.js
```

See the documentation for your operating system for details on setting environment variables. A useful guide for Linux users can be found here https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps.

### Remote server

The Remote Server source connects CDN to any publicly available URL where you are hosting your assets and images.

The [configuration file](#configuration) contains two sections for configuring a Remote Server source. One section is for images and the other is for assets. This makes it possible to store your images and assets in different locations on a remote server, or even use different servers for each.

**Configuration for a Remote Server image source**
```js
"images": {
  "remote": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "http://media.example.com/public/images"
  }
}
```

**Configuration for a Remote Server asset source**
```js
"assets": {
  "remote": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "http://media.example.com/public/assets"
  }
}
```

> Setting the `enabled` property is essential only when you're using the legacy Path URL scheme. In that case, only one of the source types can be configured for use at any one time, by setting it's `enabled` property to `true`.

**A full Remote Server image source configuration, using the Path URL scheme**
```js
"images": {
  "s3": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "remote": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "http://media.example.com/public/images"
  },
  "directory": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Local filesystem

The [configuration file](#configuration) contains two sections for configuring a Local Filesystem source. One section is for images and the other is for assets. Specifying image and asset settings separately allows you to use different filesystem locations for each one.

**Configuration for a Local Filesystem image source**
```js
"images": {
  "directory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "path/to/your/images"
  }
}
```

**Configuration for a Local Filesystem asset source**
```js
"assets": {
  "directory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "path/to/your/assets"
  }
}
```

> Setting the `enabled` property is essential only when you're using the legacy Path URL scheme. In that case, only one of the source types can be configured for use at any one time, by setting it's `enabled` property to `true`.

**A full Local Filesystem image source configuration, using the Path URL scheme**
```js
"images": {
  "s3": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "remote": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "directory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "path/to/your/images"
  }
}
```

## Serving Images and Assets

With your [sources](#defining-sources) configured so that CDN knows where to find them, you can start sending requests for your assets and images.

CDN currently responds to two types of URL scheme. One, the Path URL scheme, is a legacy format and exists for backwards compatibility with early-adoption client applications. The other, the Querystring URL Scheme, is succinct, flexible and robust.

> The Querystring URL Scheme is the preferred format and is where future development efforts will be focused. In the event that new image manipulation parameters are added to CDN, the Querystring URL Scheme will be the only format that supports them.  

### The URL Schemes

While the Querystring URL Scheme is preferred for new applications, both are documented here. If you don't need details about the Path URL Scheme, [jump right to the Querystring URL Scheme](#querystring-url-scheme).

> For a complete guide to the image manipulation parameters, see the [Image Parameters](#image-parameters).


#### Path URL Scheme

Version 1.0.0-Beta of CDN used the URL path for specifying parameters. In this scheme, there are 17 parameters that can be used to manipulate images and 1 parameter for assets. All parameters must be supplied - those that aren't required should be set to `0`.

##### Serving Images via the Path URL Scheme

**Format**

```
https://domain/format/quality/trim/trimFuzz/width/height/crop-x/crop-y/ratio/devicePixelRatio/crop/gravity/filter/blur/strip/rotate/flip/path
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/jpg/80/0/0/640/480/10/10/16-9/1/aspectfill/North/lanczos/3/0/45/x/cars/aston-martin.jpg
```

##### Serving Assets via the Path URL Scheme

**Format**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/css/0/styles/main.css
```

**Example**

```
https://domain/format/compress/path
```

#### Querystring URL Scheme

Version 1.0.0 of CDN introduced this URL format for specifying parameters. You only need to supply the parameters you need to use, specifying as many or as few as you want.

> **Note:** The differentiation between the Path and Querystring URL schemes is the inclusion of a querystring (i.e. everything following the `?` in the URL). If you need to serve an image in it's original, unmodified state, add a dummy querystring to the request to tell CDN you're using the Querystring URL Scheme. For example: `https://cdn.somedomain.tech/cars/aston-martin.jpg?v2`

##### Serving Images via the Querystring URL Scheme

**Format**

```
https://domain/path?querystring-parameters
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/cars/aston-martin.jpg?w=600&h=400
```

##### Serving Assets via the Querystring URL Scheme

**Format**

```
https://domain/path?querystring-parameters
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/styles/main.css?compress=0
```

### Locating Files

There is one common piece to the URL schemes: the `path` segment that CDN uses to locate the file to be served. In the Path URL Scheme it comes after all the parameters and in the Querystring URL Scheme it's between the [dynamic source parameter](#dynamic-sources) (if used) and the querystring.

Ignoring the parameters for a moment, the following sections explain how CDN locates your files for each source.

#### Amazon S3 source

When you connect CDN to an Amazon S3 source, the `path` in the URL is used to locate the file within the S3 bucket you specified in the configuration file.

Depending on the region in your configuration, CDN might construct a URL similar to one the following:

* region `us-east-1`: http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
* any other region: http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com

In the following example CDN will attempt to load the image from the `S3 URL` shown in the final column:

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/cars/aston-martin.jpg?w=400
```

|Bucket|Region|Path|S3 URL
|:--|:--|:--
|`my-images`|`eu-west-1`|`cars/aston-martin.jpg`|`http://my-images.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cars/aston-martin.jpg`

#### Remote Server source

When you connect CDN to a Remote Server source, the `path` in the URL is added to the `path` you specified in the configuration file, resulting in a remote URL (which must be publicly accessible).

In the following example CDN will attempt to load the image from the `Remote Location` shown in the final column:

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/cars/aston-martin.jpg?w=400
```

|Configuration|Path|Remote Location
|:--|:--|:--
|`"path": "http://media.example.com/public/images"`|`cars/aston-martin.jpg`|`http://media.example.com/public/images/cars/aston-martin.jpg`

#### Local Filesystem source

When you connect CDN to a Local Filesystem source, the `path` in the URL is relative to the `path` you specified in the configuration file.

In the following example CDN will look in the `File Location` shown in the final column:

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/cars/aston-martin.jpg?w=400
```

|Configuration|URL|File Location
|:--|:--|:--
|`"path": "/data/media/images"`|`cars/aston-martin.jpg`|`/data/media/images/cars/aston-martin.jpg`


### Dynamic Sources

Adding a `source` parameter to the request URL allows you to specify which connected source CDN serves your asset or image from. This feature allows you to store assets and images in multiple places and serve them all from a single CDN installation.

When you add a `source` parameter CDN reads the standard configuration block for that source, but ignores the `enabled` property. By specifying it in the URL you're essentially saying "it's enabled".

> **Querystring URL Scheme Only**
> 
> Sources can only be specified in the URL if using the Querystring URL Scheme. When using the Path URL Scheme a single source can be configured for use at any one time.
> -- warning

For each of the below source types, refer to the [Locating Files](#locating-files) section above to understand how CDN interprets the path to your files.

#### Specifying an Amazon S3 source in the URL

**Format**

```
https://domain/s3/bucket-name/path?querystring-parameters
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/s3/images/cars/aston-martin.jpg?width=600&height=400
```

#### Specifying a Remote Server source in the URL

**Format**

```
https://domain/http/path?querystring-parameters
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/http/cars/aston-martin.jpg?width=600&height=400
```

#### Specifying a Local Filesystem source in the URL

**Format**

```
https://domain/disk/path?querystring-parameters
```

**Example**

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/disk/cars/aston-martin.jpg?width=600&height=400
```


### Serving Assets

Notice that in each of the examples below, the Querystring URL Scheme does not require the format to be specified, as it is inferred from the file extension.

#### CSS

**Formats**

## Applying Parameters to Images

Now that you have your [sources](#defining-sources) configured and have decided on the URL scheme you're going to use, you can start applying parameters to manipulate your images.

We’ll show a basic example, then it's over to you to experiment with the parameters to match your requirements. For a full list of available parameters, see the [Image Parameters](#image-parameters) section.

### Basic Parameter Example

For this example we're going to imagine you have a magazine-style website with a list of articles on the homepage and an article page. We'll start with the following image, which your editor wants to use as the main article image.

**Original image, 5616 × 3744 px, 4MB**

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg`

This is a large image, and it's not going to fit easily into the two spaces we have available for it. Unfortunately, no one in the department knows how to use Adobe Photoshop to make appropriately sized images. Fortunately, CDN can handle this task for you.

#### Resizing and Cropping

On the article page, let’s assume your main image spot is a 500×300 pixel container. It's an odd size, but illustrates this concept well. To fit the base image into that container, we’ll need to change the dimensions and crop some data from the top and bottom.

To adjust the image we need to specify the new width and height, as well as tell CDN how we want to crop the image.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=500&h=300&resize=entropy`

* `width=500&height=300`: Sets the width and height to fit the container.

* `resize=entropy`: Tells CDN how to determine the crop area. [Entropy](#entropy) is a smart cropping feature that adjusts the crop area to ensure the important part of your image is retained. It uses areas of high contrast to set the crop area.

**Resized image, 500 × 300 px, 98kB**

![Resized image, 500 × 300 px, 98kB](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=500&h=300&resize=entropy "Image credit: Danielle MacInnes (https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes)")

Now, on the homepage, let’s assume each feature article has an image container that is 200×200 pixels. With the main subject of the image so close to the right, we'll once again need to tell CDN how we want the image cropped.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=200&h=200&resize=entropy`

**Resized image, 200 × 200 px, 29kB**

![Resized image, 200 × 200 px, 29kB](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=200&h=200&resize=entropy "Image credit: Danielle MacInnes (https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes)")

If we don't specify `entropy` as the `resize` parameter, CDN defaults to using `aspectfit` and our image would look a little different, with the main subject almost excluded from the image.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=200&h=200`

![Aspectfill, 200 × 200 px, 29kB](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?w=200&h=200 "Image credit: Danielle MacInnes (https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes)")

## Resizing images

Images can be easily resized using DADI CDN. Use the `resize` parameter with `width` and `height` to resize images, or specify `crop` along with crop coordinates for full control over the portion of the original image that is retained.

There are several ways to resize an image, the simplest of which is to specify the dimensions of the output images. Use `width` and `height` parameters to specify the final dimensions of the output image.

### Using the width parameter

The `width` parameter (also `w`) specifies the width of the required output image in pixels. If only `width` is specified, the height dimension will be _set to the height of the original image_. If both width and height are omitted, the original image’s dimensions are used.

> **Security Note:**
> 
> The maximum output image size can be specified in the configuration file.
> 
> The `security` setting allows you to set a maximum width and height for generated images. This prevents the potential for a DOS attack based on the repeated generation of large images which could push your platform offline by exhausting CPU and/or available memory.
>
> You should set this to the maximum size required for images in your application.
>
> ```json
> "security": {
>  "maxWidth": 2048,
>  "maxHeight": 1024
>}
>```
> -- advice

**Example**

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400`

To ensure the output image retains the aspect ratio of the original image, you can pass a `resizeStyle` parameter: `https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400&resizeStyle=aspectfit`.

| **w=400** | **w=400&resize=aspectfit** 
|:--|:--
| ![Width 400](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400 "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)") | ![Width 400, Aspect Fit](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400&resize=aspectfit "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)") 
 
### Using the height parameter

The `height` parameter (also `h`) specifies the height of the required output image in pixels. If only `height` is specified, the width dimension will be _set to the width of the original image_. If both width and height are omitted, the original image’s dimensions are used.

> **Security Note:**
> 
> The maximum output image size can be specified in the configuration file.
> 
> The `security` setting allows you to set a maximum width and height for generated images. This prevents the potential for a DOS attack based on the repeated generation of large images which could push your platform offline by exhausting CPU and/or available memory.
>
> You should set this to the maximum size required for images in your application.
>
> ```json
> "security": {
>  "maxWidth": 2048,
>  "maxHeight": 1024
>}
>```
> -- advice

**Example**

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400`

To ensure the output image retains the aspect ratio of the original image, you can pass a `resizeStyle` parameter: `https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400&resizeStyle=aspectfit`.

| **h=400** | **h=400&resize=aspectfit** 
|:--|:--
| ![Height 400](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400 "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)") | ![Height 400, Aspect Fit](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400&resize=aspectfit "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)") 

### Maintaining aspect ratio

Images can be resized to a specified aspect ratio by providing a width or height in combination with the `ratio` parameter. CDN will respect any [resizeStyle](#specifying-a-resizestyle) specified.

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400&ratio=16-9
```

![Height 400, Aspect Ratio 16-9](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400&ratio=16-9 "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)") 


### Specifying a resizeStyle

The `resizeStyle` (also `resize`) parameter allows you to specify how CDN should fit your image into the specified dimensions.

#### aspectfill

Keeps the aspect ratio of the original image and generates an output image of the specified width and height. The output image may be cropped, however by specifying the `gravity` parameter you can tell CDN which part of the image should be retained.

> The output image is 400 x 300 pixels.

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400&h=300&resize=aspectfill "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)")

#### aspectfit

Keeps the aspect ratio of the original image and generates an output image with the maximum dimensions that fit inside the specified width and height.

> The output image is 400 x 267 pixels.

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?w=400&h=300&resize=aspectfit "Image credit: Roberto Nickson (https://unsplash.com/@rpnickson)")

#### fill

Ignores the aspect ratio of the original image and generates an output image with specified width and height. The output image may appear squashed or stretched.

> The output image is 400 x 300 pixels.

Used in combination with width and height parameters, `entropy` crops the image using a technique that determines the most important areas. Areas of higher contrast are considered more important, and images are often cropped to remove large areas of static colour.

#### crop

When `crop` is used as the resize style then an additional parameter must be used to specify the coordinates of the crop rectangle. There are two ways to pass the crop rectangle coordinates:

**Specify only the top left corner of the rectangle**

`?resizeStyle=crop&crop=10,15`

**Specify the top left corner and the bottom right corner of the rectangle**

`?resizeStyle=crop&crop=10,15,200,300`

> Note: when using the legacy Path URL Schema, parameters for `crop-x` and `crop-y` are passed instead. `crop-x` and `crop-y` are used in the same way as the two-coordinate crop above - that is, they specify the top left corner of the crop rectangle.

#### gravity

Used to position the crop area. Available options (case sensitive): `northwest`, `north`, `northeast`, `west`, `center`, `east`, `southWest`, `south`, `southeast`, `none`

**Example**

## Cropping Images

For more control over the output image than available when using the standard resize style options `aspectFit`, `aspectFill`, `fit` and `fill`, you can specify three different ways to crop your images.

### Top & Left Crop

By specifying only the top left corner of the crop rectangle, CDN works out the full crop rectangle size by using the specified width and height parameters. To obtain an image that is 300 wide and 400 high, but cropped from 100 pixels from the top edge:

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/med.jpeg?resize=crop&crop=0,10&width=300&height=400`

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/med.jpeg?resize=crop&crop=0,10&width=300&height=400 "Image credit: Anthony DELANOIX (https://unsplash.com/@anthonydelanoix)")

### Crop Rectangle

It is also possible to supply both the top left and the bottom right co-ordinates of a crop rectangle: `resize=crop&crop=0,0,100,100` etc. This allows you to selectively crop an exact area out of an image.

Let's take a look at some examples. We'll use our `400x400` pixel image, which has squares marked at `x, y (size)`: `0,0 (25 px)`, `25,25 (25px)`, `50,50 (50px)`, `100,100 (100px)`, `200,200 (200px)`: 

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png)

We can crop the second and third boxes by supplying a top left of `50,50`, and a bottom right of `200,200`, giving us a `150x150` pixel image:

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200`

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200)

We're also able to change the size of the image we get back. Let's change it to `100` pixels wide. In this case, the height will be inferred from the width. The same goes if we only supply a height.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=100`

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=100)

If you really want to get creative, you can supply a cropping rectangle along with both a width and height, which will allow you to completely resize an image after cropping. Let's take the above image and squash it.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=400&height=100`

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=400&height=100)

Another way of resizing our crops, if we don't want to be as specific, is to provide the `devicePixelRatio` ratio.

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&devicePixelRatio=2`

![](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&&devicePixelRatio=2)

Read more about [dealing with pixel ratios](#dealing-with-pixel-ratios).

### Entropy

Using `resize=entropy` crops the image using a technique that determines the most important areas.

Read more about [entropy](#entropy).

## Image Parameters

### blur: adding blur to an image

The `blur` parameter adds blur to an image, using any value above zero.

- **Accepts:** any number from 1-100
- **Default:** 0
- **Alias:** `b`

**Examples**

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?blur=5`

### filter: interpolation filter

The `filter` parameter allows you to specify the interpolation method to use when resizing images. When reducing the size of an image (or downsampling), some image data is simply discarded. However when increasing image dimensions, the image is expanded and gaps must be "filled in". Each interpolation filter uses a different algorithm for determining how to fill the gaps.

- **Accepts:** valid values are `lanczos`, `nearest-neighbor`, `linear`, `cubic`, `grid`, `moving-average`
- **Default:** `lanczos`
- **Alias:** `f`

**Example**

```http
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?width=600&height=400&resize=aspectfill&filter=linear
```

#### Filters

**nearest-neighbor:** The simplest approach to interpolation. Rather than calculating an average value by some weighting criteria or generating an intermediate value based on complicated rules, this method simply determines the "nearest" neighbouring pixel, and assumes the intensity value of it.

**linear:** Considers the closest two pixels and takes a weighted average to arrive at its final interpolated value. Results in a much smoother image than `nearest-neighbor`.

**cubic:** Images resampled with cubic interpolation are smoother and have fewer interpolation artifacts, but processing is slower than with `linear` or `nearest-neighbor`.

**lanczos:** Tends to reduce aliasing artifacts and preserve sharp edges. [It has been considered the "best compromise"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.116.7898) among several simple filters for this purpose.


### flip: flipping an image

The `flip` parameter flips images horizontally, vertically or both. A horizontal flip can also be referred to as "mirroring".

- **Accepts:** valid values are `x`, `y` and `xy`
- **Default:** 0
- **Alias:** `fl`

| **Horizontal flip: ?flip=x**  | **Vertical flip: ?flip=y**  | **Horizontal and vertical flip: ?flip=xy**  
|:--|:--|:--
| ![Dog flipped on the X axis](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?resize=aspectfit&w=600&flip=x "Image credit: Yamon Figurs (https://unsplash.com/@yamonf16)") | ![Dog flipped on the Y axis](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?resize=aspectfit&w=600&flip=y "Image credit: Yamon Figurs (https://unsplash.com/@yamonf16)") | ![Dog flipped on both axes](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?resize=aspectfit&w=600&flip=xy "Image credit: Yamon Figurs (https://unsplash.com/@yamonf16)")

### format: converting images

Use the `format` parameter to specify the required output image format.

- **Accepts:** valid values are `jpg`, `png`
- **Default:** output defaults to the same as the input image 
- **Alias:** `fmt`

DADI CDN can currently convert the following:

| **From** | **To**
|:--|:--

### gravity: position the crop area

Available options (case sensitive):

`northwest`, `north`, `northeast`, `west`, `center`, `east`, `southWest`, `south`, `southeast`, `none`

### height: set image height

The `height` parameter is used to specify the required height of the output image, in pixels.

- **Default:** original height dimension
- **Alias:** `h`

If only height is specified, the width dimension will be _set to the width of the original image_. If you'd like to ensure the output image retains the aspect ratio of the original image, please ensure `resize=aspectfit` is specified.

If both width and height are omitted, the original image’s dimensions are used.

> **Security Note:**
> 
> The maximum output image size can be specified in the configuration file.
> 
> The `security` setting allows you to set a maximum width and height for generated images. This prevents the potential for a DOS attack based on the repeated generation of large images which could push your platform offline by exhausting CPU and/or available memory.
>
> You should set this to the maximum size required for images in your application.
>
> ```json
> "security": {
>  "maxWidth": 2048,
>  "maxHeight": 1024
>}

### quality: image compression

The `quality` parameter applies compression to an image, reducing it's file size.

- **Accepts:** any number from 1-100
- **Default:** 75
- **Alias:** `q`

The best results for quality and file size can be found around 40-60, where we've found generated images to be visually indistinguishable from the source image.

**Examples**

The original image and all quality variations below are 2048 × 1024 pixels.

### ratio: resize to aspect ratio

Use the `ratio` parameter in combination with width (`w`) or height (`h`) to crop the image to the specified aspect ratio. [Resize styles](/#cdn/specifying-a-resizestyle) are respected.

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?h=400&ratio=16-9
```

### rotate: rotating an image

The `rotate` parameter rotates the image according to the value specified in degrees. The image will be zoomed so that it covers the entire area after rotation.

- **Accepts:** any number from 0-359
- **Default:** 0

### saturate: adjust image saturation

The `saturate` parameter increases or reduces an image's colour saturation and can be used to convert it to black and white.

- **Accepts:** 0 or 1
- **Default:** none
- **Alias:** `sat`


To desaturate (convert to black and white), use `0` or any number below 0.

```http
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?saturate=0
```
| **Saturate amount = 0 (B&W)**  |   **Saturate amount = 1**

### sharpen: sharpen an image

The `sharpen` parameter adds sharpness to an image.

- **Accepts:** any number from 0-100
- **Default:** 1
- **Alias:** `sh`

**Example**

```http
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?sharpen=10

### width: set image width

The `width` parameter is used to specify the required width of the output image, in pixels.

- **Default:** original width dimension
- **Alias:** `w`

If only width is specified, the height dimension will be _set to the height of the original image_. If you'd like to ensure the output image retains the aspect ratio of the original image, please ensure `resize=aspectfit` is specified.

If both width and height are omitted, the original image’s dimensions are used.

## Layout Processor

The layout processor provides a way to generate a new image by combining colour tiles with existing images accessible by CDN.

A request to CDN specifying the processor name of "layout" and including a set of input images (or colour tiles) along with a size and position for each, will result in a new image being rendered as the response.

Each part of the request must be separated by a pipe character: `|`

**Example request**

The following request contains the following:

* Inputs:
  * the image `samples/dog.jpeg`, resized to 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high, positioned at 0,0 in the output image
  * a tile with the colour `#01EE88`, 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high, positioned at 0,200 in the output image
  * the image `samples/canoe.jpeg`, resized to 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high, positioned at 0,400 in the output image
* Output: an image 600 pixels wide by 300 pixels high, in JPEG format

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/layout/i:samples/dog.jpeg,h_300,w_200,x_0,y_0%7Cc:01ee88,h_300,w_200,x_200,y_0%7Ci:samples/canoe.jpeg,h_300,w_200,x_400,y_0%7Co:output.jpg,h_300,w_600
```

![Output image](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/layout/i:samples/dog.jpeg,h_300,w_200,x_0,y_0%7Cc:01ee88,h_300,w_200,x_200,y_0%7Ci:samples/canoe.jpeg,h_300,w_200,x_400,y_0%7Co:output.jpg,h_300,w_600)

### Input Images

An input image is specified in the request using the format `i:IMAGE_URL,h_HEIGHT,w_WIDTH,x_HORIZONTAL,y_VERTICAL`

* `IMAGE_URL`: the path to an existing image accessible by the CDN
* `h_HEIGHT`: the height the input image should be resized to, in pixels
* `w_WIDTH`: the width the input image should be resized to, in pixels

`x_HORIZONTAL` and `y_VERTICAL` control the position of the input image inside the output image, specifying where the top left corner of the image should be placed.

**Example:** `i:path/to/image.jpg,w_640,h_480,x_0,y_0`

### Colour tiles

A colour tile can be used as an input image by using the format `c:COLOUR,h_HEIGHT,w_WIDTH,x_HORIZONTAL,y_VERTICAL`

* `COLOUR`: a colour in hexadecimal format, for example `F3EACD`
* `h_HEIGHT`: the height the tile should be on the output image, in pixels
* `w_WIDTH`: the width the tile should be on the output image, in pixels

`x_HORIZONTAL` and `y_VERTICAL` control the position of the tile inside the output image, specifying where the top left corner should be placed.

**Example:** `c:F3EACD,w_320,h_480,x_320,y_0`

### Output Image

The format and dimensions of the output image are controlled using the output image portion of the request, using the format `o:IMAGE_URL,h_HEIGHT,w_WIDTH`

* `IMAGE_URL`: an image name and extension - used to determine the output format. For example `output.jpg` will return an image encoded as JPEG.
* `h_HEIGHT`: the desired height of the output image, in pixels
* `w_WIDTH`:  the desired width of the output image, in pixels

**Example:** `o:test.png,w_640,h_480`

## Pre-signed URLs

A pre-signed URL allows you to give one-off access to private S3 objects, useful for when users may not have direct access to the file. Pre-signing generates a valid URL signed with your S3 credentials that any user can access.

### Generating a pre-signed URL

To generate a simple pre-signed URL that allows any user to view the contents of a private object in a bucket you own,
you can use the following call to `getSignedUrl`:

```js
var AWS = require('aws-sdk')

AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: '<your-access-key-id>',
  secretAccessKey: '<your-secret-access-key>'
})

var params = {
  Bucket: '<your-bucket-name>',
  Key: '<your-filename>'
}

var s3 = new AWS.S3()

s3.getSignedUrl('getObject', params, function (err, url) {
  console.log("The URL is", url)
})
```

The above should result in a response similar to this:

```bash
The URL is https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/your-filename?AWSAccessKeyId=your-access-key-id&Expires=1490052681&Signature=VzHKnHucNgKPG7lDbnzW6blQuGQ%3D
```

### Controlling Expiry Time

The default `Expires` time is 15 minutes. This can be modified by passing a value in the
params that are passed to the `getSignedUrl` method. The following example will cause the
signed URL to expire after 60 seconds.

```js
var params = {
  Bucket: 'myBucket',
  Key: 'myKey',
  Expires: 60 // expire time, in seconds
}
```

### Accessing via CDN

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/your-filename?AWSAccessKeyId=your-access-key-id&Expires=1490052681&Signature=VzHKnHucNgKPG7lDbnzW6blQuGQ%3D
```

### Adding image manipulation parameters

When requesting images from external URLs it is possible they have an existing querystring. To
add CDN image manipulation parameters to an external URL, they must be added to the existing querystring.

The following example uses the above URL, adding `width` and `height` parameters.

> Notice that we've added the parameters as part of the existing querystring by including an ampersand before the CDN querystring begins:
>
>...W6blQuGQ%3D**&?**width=300&height=300
> -- advice

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/your-filename?AWSAccessKeyId=your-access-key-id&Expires=1490052681&Signature=VzHKnHucNgKPG7lDbnzW6blQuGQ%3D&?width=300&height=300
```

### Expired URLs

If a pre-signed URL has already expired at the time of the request, a HTTP 403 Forbidden error will be returned:

```json
{"statusCode":"403","message":"Forbidden: https://cdn.somedomain.tech/https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/your-filename?AWSAccessKeyId=your-access-key-id&Expires=1490052681&Signature=VzHKnHucNgKPG7lDbnzW6blQuGQ%3D"}
```

## Delivery Recipes

A Delivery Recipe is a predefined set of image manipulation parameters stored in a JSON file and applied to images at the time of request.

Let's use the image from our magazine example:

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/thumbnail/samples/beach.jpeg`

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?width=100&height=100&resizeStyle=entropy`

![Thumbnail image, 100 × 100 px, 9kB](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/beach.jpeg?width=100&height=100&resizeStyle=entropy "Image credit: Danielle MacInnes (https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes)")

Recipes are defined in JSON files held in the `/workspace/recipes` folder.

### Example recipe

```json
{
  "recipe": "thumbnail",
  "settings": {
    "format": "jpg",
    "quality": "80",
    "width": "100",
    "height": "100",
    "resizeStyle": "entropy"
  }
}
```

### Using a recipe

Making use of a recipe is simple: call your image via the recipe name defined in the recipe JSON.

For example:

`https://cdn.somedomain.tech/thumbnail/image-filename.png`

## Retrieving a colour palette

Information about each image stored in _CDN_ can be returned as a JSON object with information on how the image was generated. Within that object there are `primaryColor` and `palette` properties which contain information about the colour of the image.

Request URL:

```
https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?format=json
```

Response JSON:

```json
{
  "primaryColor": "#1888a2",
  "palette": {
    "rgb": [
      [173, 220, 233],
      [23, 109, 129],
      [244, 240, 230],
      [116, 87, 68],
      [179, 150, 133]
    ],
    "hex": [
      "#addce9",
      "#176d81",
      "#f4f0e6",
      "#745744",
      "#b39685"
    ]
  }

The default number of colours in the palette is 6. This can be controlled by sending `colours` in the querystring. For example: http://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/canoe.jpeg?format=json&colours=5.

> Note: the `colours` parameter can only be added if you are using version 2 of the CDN URL syntax.

## Dealing with pixel ratios

When dealing with multiple device pixel ratios, you can 'multiply' the outputted size of the image by adding the parameter `devicePixelRatio` to your query. `devicePixelRatio` can be anywhere from 1 to 3. Supplying this parameter will inform the CDN to multiply the output dimensions by that factor.

For example a `100px x 100px` image with the variable `devicePixelRatio=2` will return an image of `200px x 200px` in size. You can then scale down the image in your front-end output e.g.,

```html
<img src="https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/dog.jpeg?w=100&height=100&devicePixelRatio=2" width="100">
```

But why not just use `width=200&height=200`, right? Well `devicePixelRatio` becomes more powerful when cropping, for example. You could crop an image to take out a `150px x 150px` chunk:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200" width="300">
```

![150x150](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200)

and then enlarge it to `300px x 300px`:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&devicePixelRatio=2" width="300">
```

![300x300](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&devicePixelRatio=2)

It is also possible to set the width, height, or both width & height explicitly, if we wanted an image of 600x600 for a HDPI display, etc:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=600" width="300">
```

![600x600](https://cdn.somedomain.tech/samples/measure.png?resize=crop&crop=50,50,200,200&width=600)

## Caching

Caching improves performance in CDN by storing images that have been modified by image manipulation parameters either on the local filesystem or in a Redis server. THhe main configuration file can be used to configure global caching settings:

| Path | Description | Default | Format
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
| `caching.ttl` | The number of seconds until a cached item is considered stale | `3600` | Number
| `caching.directory.enabled` | If true, cache files will be saved to the filesystem |  `true` | Boolean
| `caching.directory.path` | The relative path to the cache directory | `"./cache/"` | String
| `caching.redis.enabled` | If true, cache files will be saved to the specified Redis server |   | Boolean
| `caching.redis.host` | The Redis server host |   | String
| `caching.redis.port` | The port for the Redis server |  `6379` | port

```json
"caching": {
  "ttl": 3600,
  "directory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "./cache/"
  },
  "redis": {
    "enabled": false,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 6379
  }
}
```

### Connecting to Redis

In the event that CDN can't connect to a configured Redis server, caching will fallback to using the local filesystem as the caching layer. When the Redis server is again reachable, CDN will need a restart to reconnect.


### Caching by MIME type

Browser cache settings can be varied by MIME type. Use the `headers.cacheControl` section of the configuration file to configure the cache for different MIME types: 

```json
"headers": {
  "cacheControl": {
    "default": "public, max-age=3600",
    "paths": [],
    "mimetypes": [
      { "image/jpeg": "public, max-age=86400" },
      { "text/css": "public, max-age=86400" },
      { "text/javascript": "public, max-age=86400" },
      { "application/javascript": "public, max-age=86400" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Server status

A "status" endpoint can be enabled at `/api/status` for performance monitoring. Add a `status` configuration section to the main configuration file using the settings below.

| Path | Description | Environment variable | Default | Format
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
| `status.enabled` | If true, status endpoint is enabled. | *N/A* | `true` | Boolean
| `status.requireAuthentication` | If true, status endpoint requires authentication. | *N/A* | `true` | Boolean
| `status.standalone` | If true, status endpoint will run on an standalone address/port. | *N/A* |  | Boolean
| `status.port` | Accept connections on the specified port. A value of zero will assign a random port. | `STATUS_PORT` | `8003` | Number
| `status.routes` | An array of routes to test. Each route object must contain properties `route` and `expectedResponseTime`. Note, `expectedResponseTime` is seconds. | *N/A* | `[{"route":"/test.jpg?format=png&quality=50&width=800&height=600","expectedResponseTime":0.025}]` | Array

To use the status endpoint an access token must first be obtained by sending a POST request to the `/token` endpoint with the body of the request containing the credentials from the configuration file's "auth" section:

```json
"auth": {
  "tokenUrl": "/token",
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "secret": "your-secret"
}
```

```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: cdn.somedomain.tech
Connection: close
Content-Length: 65

{
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "secret": "your-secret"
}
```

With a request like the above, you should expect a response containing an access token, as below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Length: 95

{
  "accessToken": "4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

With an access token obtained, send a POST request to `/api/status` using the access token as the value for the `Authorization` header:

```http
POST /api/status HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Host: cdn.somedomain.tech
Connection: close
```
