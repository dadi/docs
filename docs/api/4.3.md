## Requirements

Microservices in the DADI platform are built on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

DADI follows the Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) release schedule, and as such the version of Node.js required to run DADI products is coupled to the version of Node.js currently in Active LTS. See the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) for further information.

## Creating an API

The easiest way to install API is using DADI CLI. CLI is a command line application that can be used to create and maintain installations of DADI products. Follow the simple instructions below, or see [more detailed documentation for DADI CLI](/cli).

### Install DADI CLI

```console
$ npm install @dadi/cli -g
```

### Create new API installation

There are two ways to create a new API with the CLI: either manually create a new directory for API or let CLI handle that for you. DADI CLI accepts an argument for `project-name` which it uses to create a directory for the installation.

*Manual directory creation*

```console
$ mkdir my-api
$ cd my-api
$ dadi api new
```

*Automatic directory creation*

```console
$ dadi api new my-api
$ cd my-api
```

DADI CLI will install the latest version of API and copy a set of files to your chosen directory so you can launch API almost immediately.

> **Installing DADI API directly from NPM**
>
> All DADI platform microservices are also available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). To add *API* to an existing project as a dependency:

> ```console
> $ cd my-existing-node-app
> $ npm install --save @dadi/api
> ```
> -- advice


## Application Anatomy

When CLI finishes creating your API, the application directory will contain the basic requirements for launching your API. The following directories and files have been created for you:

```console
my-api/
  config/              # contains environment-specific configuration files
    config.development.json
  server.js            # the entry point for the application
  package.json
  workspace/
    collections/       # collection specification files
    endpoints/         # custom JavaScript endpoints
```

## Configuration

API reads a series of configuration parameters to define its behaviour and to adapt to each environment it runs on. These parameters are defined in JSON files placed inside the `config/` directory, named as `config.{ENVIRONMENT}.json`, where `{ENVIRONMENT}` is the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. In practice, this allows you to have different configuration parameters for when API is running in development, production and any staging, QA or anything in between, as per the requirements of your development workflow.

Some configuration parameters also have corresponding environment variables, which will override whatever value is set in the configuration file.

The following table shows a list of all the available configuration parameters.

## Authentication

DADI API provides a full-featured authentication layer based on the [Client Credentials flow of oAuth 2.0](http://oauthbible.com/#oauth-2-two-legged). Consumers must exchange a set of client credentials for a temporary access token, which must be appended to API requests.

A client is represented as a set of credentials (ID + secret) and an access type, which can be set to `admin` or `user`. If set to `admin`, the client can perform any operation in API without any restrictions. If not, they will be subject to the rules set in the [access control list](#access-control).

### Adding clients

If you've installed [DADI CLI](/cli) you can use that to create a new client in the database. See instructions for [Adding clients with CLI](/cli#api-clientsadd).

Alternatively, use the built in NPM script to start the Client Record Generator which will present you with a series of questions about the new client and insert a record into the configured database.

```console
$ npm explore @dadi/api -- npm run create-client
```

> **Creating the client in the correct database**
>
> To ensure the correct database is used for your environment, add an environment variable to the command:
>
> ```console
> $ NODE_ENV=production npm explore @dadi/api -- npm run create-client
> ```
> -- warning

### Obtaining an access token

Obtain an access token by sending a `POST` request to your API's token endpoint, passing your client credentials in the body of the request. The token endpoint is configurable using the property [`auth.tokenRoute`](#configuration), with a default value of `/token`.

```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Connection: close
Content-Length: 65

{
  "clientId": "my-client-key",
  "secret": "my-client-secret"
}
```

With a request like the above, you should expect a response containing an access token, as below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Length: 95

{
  "accessToken": "4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 3600,
  "accessType": "admin"
}
```

### Using an access token

Once you have an access token, each request to the API should include an `Authorization` header containing the token:

```http
GET /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Connection: close
```

### Access token expiry

The response returned when requesting an access token contains a property `expiresIn` which is set to the number of seconds the access token is valid for. When this period has elapsed, API automatically invalidates the access token and a subsequent request to API using that access token will return an [invalid token error](#authentication-errors).

The consumer application must request a new access token to continue communicating with the API.

### Internal collections

Internally, API uses three collections to store authentication data:

- `clientStore`: stores API clients
- `roleStore`: stores API [roles](#roles)
- `accessStore`: stores aggregate data computed from clients, roles and permissions

The names for these collections can be configured using the `auth.clientCollection`, `auth.roleCollection` and `auth.accessCollection` configuration properties, respectively. But unless they happen to clash with the name of one of your collections, you don't need to worry about setting them.

### Collection authentication

By default, collections require all requests to be authenticated and authorised. This behaviour can be changed on a per-collection basis by changing the `authenticate` property in the [collection settings block](#collection-settings), which can be set to:

| Value | Description  | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `true` (default) | Authentication is required for all HTTP verbs | `true` |
| `false` | Authentication is not required for any HTTP verb, making the collection fully accessible to anyone | `false` |
| Array | Authentication is required only for some HTTP verbs, making the remaining verbs accessible to anyone | `["PUT", "DELETE"]` |

The following configuration for a collection will allow all GET requests to proceed without authentication, while POST, PUT and DELETE requests will require authentication.

```json
"settings": {
  "authenticate": ["POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
}
```

See [more information about collection specifications and their configuration](#collections).
  

### Authentication errors

API responds with HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors when either the supplied credentials are incorrect or an invalid token has been provided. The `WWW-Authenticate` header indicates the nature of the error. In the case of an expired access token, a new one should be requested.

#### Invalid credentials

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer, error="invalid_credentials", error_description="Invalid credentials supplied"
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 18
Date: Sun, 17 Sep 2017 17:44:48 GMT
Connection: close
```

#### Invalid or expired token

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer, error="invalid_token", error_description="Invalid or expired access token"
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 18
Date: Sun, 17 Sep 2017 17:46:28 GMT
Connection: close
```


## Access control

API includes a fully-fledged access control list (ACL) that makes it possible to specify in fine detail what each API client has permissions to do.

> **ACL terminology**
>
> The access control list specifies which [clients](#clients) can access the various [resources](#resources) of an API instance. Clients can have permissions assigned to them directly, or via [roles](#roles), which can in their turn extend other roles.
>
> -- advice

### Resources

A *resource* is any entity in API that requires some level of authorisation to be accessed, like a collection or a custom endpoint. Resources are identified by a unique key with the following formats.

| Key format | Description  | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| `clients` | Access to API clients | `clients` |
| `collection:{DB}_{NAME}` | Access to the collection named `NAME` in the database `DB` | `collection:library_book` |
| `endpoint:{VERSION}_{NAME}` | Access to the custom endpoint named `NAME` and version `VERSION` | `endpoint:v1_full-book` |
| `media:{NAME}` | Access to the media bucket named `NAME` | `media:photos` |
| `roles` | Access to API roles | `roles` |

To specify what permissions someone has over a resource, an *access matrix* is used. It consists of an object that maps each of the CRUD methods (create, read, update and delete) to a value that determines whether that operation is allowed or not.

For example, the following matrices specify that on the `library/book` collection, the given client can read any document and update their own documents, whereas in the `library/author` collection they can create, read and update any documents, being limited to deleting only the documents they have created.

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "collection:library_book": {
      "create": false,
      "delete": false,
      "deleteOwn": false,
      "read": true,
      "readOwn": false,
      "update": false,
      "updateOwn": true
    },
    "collection:library_author": {
      "create": true,
      "delete": false,
      "deleteOwn": true,
      "read": true,
      "readOwn": false,
      "update": true,
      "updateOwn": false
    }
  }
}
```

The table below shows all the CRUD methods supported.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Permission to create new instances of the resource |
| `delete` | Permission to delete instances of the resource |
| `deleteOwn` | Permission to delete instances of the resource that have been created by the requesting client |
| `read` | Permission to read instances of the resource |
| `readOwn` | Permission to read instances of the resource that have been created by the requesting client |
| `update` | Permission to update instances of the resource |
| `updateOwn` | Permission to update instances of the resource that have been created by the requesting client |

#### Advanced permissions for collection resources

When setting up the access matrix for a collection resource, it's possible to define finer-grained permissions that limit access to a subset of the fields or to documents that match a certain query.

To do this, the *Boolean* value that determines whether access is granted (`true`) or denied (`false`) gives way to an object that can contain one or both of the following properties:

- `fields`: Limits the fields that the client has access to. Uses the [MongoDB projection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/) format, meaning that fields can be included or excluded, but not both. 

    *Example:*

    ```json
    {
      "read": {
        "fields": {
          "title": 1,
          "author": 1
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- `filter`: Limits access to documents that match a given query. Supports any [filtering operator](#filtering-documents). 

    *Example:*

    ```json
    {
      "read": {
        "filter": {
          "category": {
            "$in": ["art", "architecture"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

The following table shows how each of these properties is interpreted by the various access types.

| Method | `fields` | `filter` |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `create` | *N/A* | *N/A* |
| `delete` | *N/A* | Controls which documents can be deleted |
| `deleteOwn` | *N/A* | Controls which documents can be deleted |
| `read` | Controls which fields will be displayed | Controls which documents can be read |
| `readOwn` | Controls which fields will be displayed | Controls which documents can be read |
| `update` | Controls which fields can be updated | Controls which documents can be updated |
| `updateOwn` | Controls which fields can be updated | Controls which documents can be updated |

#### Resources API

The Resources API provides a read-only endpoint for listing all the registered resources.

### Clients

Clients represent users or applications that wish to interact with API. When not given administrator privileges (i.e. `{"accessType": "admin"}` in the database record), clients are subject to permissions defined in the access control list.

#### Creating a client

The Clients API makes it possible to create a client using a RESTful endpoint, as long as the requesting client has `create` access to the `clients` resource or has administrator access.

> **Creating admin clients**
>
> For security reasons, it's not possible to create clients with administrator access via the Clients API. If you need to create one, see the [manual method](#adding-clients) of adding a client, using either the DADI CLI or the `create-client` script.
>
> -- warning

**Request**

```http
POST /api/clients HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer c389340b-718f-4eed-8e8e-3400a1c6cd5a

{
  "clientId": "eduardo",
  "secret": "squirrel"
}
```

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "results": [
    {
      "clientId": "eduardo",
      "accessType": "user",
      "resources": {},
      "roles": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The `resources` property in a client record shows the resources they have access to. By default, a client doesn't have access to anything until explicitly given the right permissions.

Let's see how we can give this client access to some resources.

#### Assigning permissions

The Clients API includes a set of RESTful endpoints to manage the resources that a client has access to. The following request would give a client full permissions to access the `library/book` collection.

**Request**

```http
POST /api/clients/eduardo/resources HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer c389340b-718f-4eed-8e8e-3400a1c6cd5a

{
  "name": "collection:library_book",
  "access": {
    "create": true,
    "delete": true,
    "read": true,
    "update": true
  }
}
```

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "results": [
    {
      "clientId": "eduardo",
      "accessType": "user",
      "resources": {
        "collection:library_book": {
          "create": true,
          "delete": true,
          "deleteOwn": false,
          "read": true,
          "readOwn": false,
          "update": true,
          "updateOwn": false       
        }
      },
      "roles": []
    }
  ]
}
```

At this point, `eduardo` can [request an access token](#obtaining-an-access-token) and access the `library/book` collection.

#### Adding data to client records

The Clients API allows developers to associate arbitrary data with client records. This can be used by consumer applications to store data like personal information, user preferences or any type of metadata.

This data is stored in an object called `data` within the client record, and it can be written to when a client is created (via a `POST` request) or at any point afterwards via an update (`PUT` request). See the [Clients API specification](#clients-api) for more details.

When updating a client, the `data` object in the request body is processed as a partial update, which means the following in relation to any existing data object associated with the record:

1. New properties will be appended to the existing data object;
1. Properties with the same name as those in existing data object will be replaced;
1. Properties set to `null` will be removed from the data object.

**Example 1** *(creating a client with data):*

```http
POST /api/clients HTTP/1.1

### Roles

A role is a group of users that share a set of permissions to access a list of resources. In practice, it's an alternative way of giving permissions to clients.

For example, imagine that you wanted to give clients *C1* and *C2* a set of permissions to access resource *R*. You could either grant permissions to that resource individually to each client record, or you could grant the permissions to a role and assign it to both clients.

#### Reconciling client and role permissions

A client may have their own resource permissions as well as permissions given by roles. Whenever a clash occurs, i.e. permissions for the same resource given directly and from a role, the access matrices are merged so that the broadest set of permissions is obtained.

For example, imagine that a client has the following access matrices for a given resource, one assigned directly and the other resulting from a role.

**Matrix 1**

```json
{
  "create": false,
  "delete": true,
  "deleteOwn": false,
  "read": {
    "filter": {
      "fieldOne": "valueOne"
    }
  },
  "readOwn": false,
  "update": {
    "fields": {
      "fieldOne": 1
    }
  },
  "updateOwn": false
}
```

**Matrix 2**

```json
{
  "create": true,
  "delete": false,
  "deleteOwn": true,
  "read": true,
  "readOwn": false,
  "update": {
    "fields": {
      "fieldTwo": 1,
      "fieldThree": 1
    }
  },
  "updateOwn": false
}
```

**Resulting matrix**

```json
{
  "create": true,
  "delete": true,
  "deleteOwn": true,
  "read": true,
  "readOwn": false,
  "update": {
    "fields": {
      "fieldOne": 1,
      "fieldTwo": 1,
      "fieldThree": 1
    }
  },
  "updateOwn": false
}
```

#### Extending roles

Roles can extend (or inherit from) other roles. If role *R1* extends role *R2*, then clients with *R1* will get the permissions granted by that role plus any permissions granted by *R2*. The inheritance chain can go on indefinitely.

Role inheritance is a good way to represent hierarchy typically present in organisations. For example, you could create a `manager` role that extends an `employee` role, since managers can usually do all the operations available to employees plus some of their own.

#### Roles API

The Roles API provides a set of RESTful endpoints that allow the creation and management of roles, including granting and revoking access to [resources](#resources).

### Using models directly

It's possible to tap into the access control list programmatically, which is useful when creating [custom JavaScript endpoints](#endpoints) or [collection hooks](#hooks). The ACL models allow you to create and modify clients and roles, as well as compute the permissions associated with a client and determine whether they can access a given resource.

The `@dadi/api` NPM module exports an `ACL` object with a series of public methods:

- [access.get()](#access.get)
- [client.create()](#clientcreate)
- [client.delete()](#clientdelete)
- [client.get()](#clientget)
- [client.resourceAdd()](#clientresourceadd)
- [client.resourceRemove()](#clientresourceremove)
- [client.resourceUpdate()](#clientresourceupdate)
- [client.roleAdd()](#clientroleadd)
- [client.roleRemove()](#clientroleremove)
- [client.update()](#clientupdate)
- [role.create()](#rolecreate)
- [role.delete()](#roledelete)
- [role.get()](#roleget)
- [role.resourceAdd()](#roleresourceadd)
- [role.resourceRemove()](#roleresourceremove)
- [role.resourceUpdate()](#roleresourceupdate)
- [role.update()](#roleupdate)

#### access.get

Returns the [access matrix](#resources) representing the permissions of a given client to access a resource.

It expects the ID of the client as well as their access type, which means you may need to obtain this information with a separate query first. The reason for this is that the client ID + access type pair are encoded in the bearer token's JWT and are easily available via the `req.dadiApiClient` property.

***Receives***:

- `client.clientId` (type: `String`): ID of the client
- `client.accessType` (type: `String`): Access type of the client
- `resource` (type: `String`): ID of the resource
- `resolveOwnTypes` (type: `Boolean`, default: `true`): Whether to translate `*Own` types (e.g. `readOwn`) into a `read` property with a filter

***Returns:***

`Promise<Object>`: an object representing an access matrix.

***Example:***

```js
const ACL = require('@dadi/api').ACL

ACL.access.get({
  clientId: 'restfulJohn',
  accessType: 'user'
}, 'collection:v1_foobar').then(access => {
  if (!access.read) {
    console.log('Client does not have `read` access!')
  }
})
```

#### client.create

Creates a new client. 

Note that all clients created using the ACL model have an access type of `user`. To create a client with an access type of `admin`, you must do so [manually](#adding-clients).

***Receives*** *(named parameters):*

- `clientId` (type: `String`): ID of the client to create
- `secret` (type: `String`): The client secret

***Returns:***

`Promise<Object>`: an object representing the newly-created client.

```js
const ACL = require('@dadi/api').ACL

ACL.client.get({
  clientId: 'restfulJohn',
  secret: 'superSecret!'
}).then(({results}) => {
  if (results.length === 0) {
    return console.log('Wrong credentials!')
  }

  console.log(results[0])
})
```

#### client.resourceAdd

## Collections

A *Collection* represents data within your API. Collections can be thought of as the data models for your application and define how API connects to the underlying data store to store and retrieve data.

API can handle the creation of new collections or tables in the configured data store simply by creating collection specification files. To connect collections to existing data, simply name the file using the same name as the existing collection/table.

All that is required to connect to your data is a collection specification file, and once that is created API provides data access over a REST endpoint and programmatically via the API's `Model` module.

### Collections directory

Collection specifications are simply JSON files stored in your application's `collections` directory. The location of this directory is configurable using the configuration property `paths.collections` but defaults to `workspace/collections`. The structure of this directory is as follows:

```console
my-api/
  workspace/
    collections/                    
      1.0/                          # API version
        library/                    # database
          collection.books.json     # collection specification file
```

**API Version**

Specific versions of your API are represented as sub-directories of the collections directory. Versioning of collections and endpoints acts as a formal contract between the API and its consumers.

Imagine a situation where a breaking change needs to be introduced — e.g. adding or removing a collection field, or changing the output format of an endpoint. A good way to handle this would be to introduce the new structure as version 2.0 and retain the old one as version 1.0, warning consumers of its deprecation and potentially giving them a window of time before the functionality is removed.

All requests to collection and custom endpoints must include the version in the URL, mimicking the hierarchy defined in the folder structure.

**Database**

Collection documents may be stored in separate databases in the underlying data store, represented by the name of the "database" directory.

> **Note** This feature is disabled by default. To enable separate databases in your API the configuration setting `database.enableCollectionDatabases` must be `true`. See [Collection-specific Databases](#collection-specific-databases) for more information.

**Collection specification file**

A collection specification file is a JSON file containing at least one field specification and a configuration block.

The naming convention for collection specifications is `collection.<collection name>.json` where `<collection name>` is used as the name of the collection/table in the underlying data store.

> **Use the plural form**
>
> We recommend you use the plural form when naming collections in order to keep consistency across your API. Using the singular form means a GET request for a list of results can easily be confused with a request for a single entity.
>
> For example, a collection named `book (collection.book.json)` will accept GET requests at the following endpoints:
>
> ```
> https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/book
> https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/book/560a44b33a4d7de29f168ce4
> ```
>
> It's not obvious whether or not the first example is going to return all books, as intended. Using the plural form makes it clear what the endpoint's intended behaviour is:
>
> ```
> https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books
> https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books/560a44b33a4d7de29f168ce4
```
> -- advice


### The Collection Endpoint

API automatically generates a REST endpoint for each collection specification loaded from the collections directory. The format of the REST endpoint follows this convention `/{version}/{database}/{collection name}` and matches the structure of the collections directory.

```console
my-api/
  workspace/
    collections/                    
      1.0/                          # API version
        library/                    # database
          collection.books.json     # collection specification file
```

With the above directory structure API will generate this REST endpoint: https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books.


### The JSON File

Collection specification files can be created and edited in any text editor, then added to the API's `collections` directory. API will load all valid collections when it boots.

#### Minimum Requirements

The JSON file must contain a `fields` property and, optionally, a `settings` property.

* `fields`: must contain at least one field specification. See [Collection Fields](#collection-fields) for the format of fields.
* `settings`: API uses sensible defaults for collection configuration, but these can be overridden using properties in the `settings` block. See [Collection Settings](#collection-settings) for details.

**A skeleton collection specification**

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "field1": {
    }
  },
  "settings": {
  }
}
```


### Collection Fields

Each field in a collection is defined using the following format. The only required property is `type` which tells API what data types the field can contain.

**A basic field specification**

```json
"fieldName": {
  "type": "String"
}
```

**A complete field specification**

```json
"fieldName": {
  "type": "String",
  "required": true,
  "label": "Title",
  "comments": "The title of the entry",
  "example": "War and Peace",
  "message": "must not be blank",
  "default": "Untitled"
  "matchType": "exact",
  "validation": {
    "minLength": 4,
    "maxLength": 20,
    "regex": {
      "pattern": "/[A-Za-z0-9]*/"
    }
  }
}
```

| Property  | Description |  Default | Example | Required?
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
| fieldName | The name of the field | | `"title"` | Yes
| type | The type of the field. Possible values `"String"`, `"Number"`, `"DateTime"`, `"Boolean"`, `"Mixed"`, `"Object"`, `"Reference"`  |  N/A  | `"String"` | Yes
| label | The label for the field | `""` | `"Title"` | No
| comments | The description of the field | `""` | `"The article title"` | No
| example | An example value for the field | `""` | `"War and Peace"` | No
| validation | Validation rules, including minimum and maximum length and regular expression patterns. | `{}` | | No
| validation.minLength | The minimum length for the field.| unlimited | `4` | No
| validation.maxLength | The maximum length for the field.| unlimited | `20` | No
| validation.regex | A regular expression the field's value must match |  | `{ "pattern": /[A-Z]*/ }` | No
| required | If true, a value must be entered for the field. | `false` | `true` | No
| message | The message to return if field validation fails.| `"is invalid"` | `"must contain uppercase letters only"` | No
| default | An optional value to use as a default if no value is supplied for this field | | `"0"` | No
| matchType | Specify the type of query that is performed when using this field. If "exact" then API will attempt to match the query value exactly, otherwise it will performa a case-insensitive query. | | `"exact"` | No
| format | Used by some fields (e.g. `DateTime`) to specify the expected format for input/output | `null` | `"YYYY-MM-DD"` | No

### Field Types

Every field in a collection must be one of the following types. All documents sent to API are validated against a collection's field type to ensure that data will be stored in the format intended. See the section on [Validation](#validation) for more details.

| Type | Description | Example
|:--|:--|:--
| String | The most basic field type, used for text data. Will also accept arrays of Strings. | `"The quick brown fox"`,  `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"]`
| Number | Accepts numeric data types including whole integers and floats | `5`, `5.01`
| DateTime | Stores dates/times. Accepts numeric values (Unix timestamp), strings in the ISO 8601 format or in any format supported by [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) as long as the pattern is defined in the `format` property of the field schema. Internally, values are *always* stored as Unix timestamps. | `"2018-04-27T13:18:15.608Z"`, `1524835111068`
| Boolean | Accepts only two possible values: `true` or `false` | `true`
| Object | Accepts single JSON documents or an array of documents | `{ "firstName": "Steve" }`
| Mixed | Can accept any of the above types: String, Number, Boolean or Object |
| Reference | Used for linking documents in the same collection or a different collection, solving the problem of storing subdocuments in documents. See [Document Composition (reference fields)](#document-composition) for further information. | the ID of another document as a String: `"560a5baf320039f7d6a78d3b"`


### Collection Settings

Each collection specification can contain a `settings`. API applies sensible defaults to collections, all of which can be overridden using properties in the `settings` block. Collection configuration is controlled in the following way:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "cache": true,
    "authenticate": true,
    "count": 100,
    "sort": "title",
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "callback": null,
    "storeRevisions": false
    "index": []
  }
}
```

| Property | Description | Default | Example
|:--|:--|:--|:--
| displayName | A friendly name for the collection. Used by the auto-generated documentation plugin.  | n/a | `"Articles"`
| cache | If true, caching is enabled for this collection. The global config must also have `cache: true` for caching to be enabled | `false` | `true`
| authenticate | Specifies whether requests for this collection require authentication, or if there only certain HTTP methods that must be authenticated | `true` | `false`, `["POST"]`
| count | The number of results to return when querying the collection | `50` | `100`
| sort | The field to sort results by | `"_id"`  | `"title"`
| sortOrder | The sort direction to sort results by | `1`  | `1` = ascending, `-1` = descending
| storeRevisions | If true, every change to a document will cause the previous version to be saved to a revision/history collection | `true` | `false`
| revisionCollection | The name of the collection used to hold revision documents | The collection name with "History" appended | `"authorsHistory"`
| callback | Name of a function to use as a JSONP callback | `null` | `setAuthors`
| defaultFilters | Specifies a default query for the collection. A `filter` parameter passed in the querystring will extend these filters.  | `{}` | `{ "published": true }`
| fieldLimiters | Specifies a list of fields for inclusion/exclusion in the response. Fields can be included or excluded, but not both. See [Retrieving data](#retrieving-data) for more detail. | `{}` | `{ "title": 1, "author": 1 }`, `{ "dob": 0, "state": 0 }`
| index | Specifies a set of indexes that should be created for the collection. See [Creating Database Indexes](#creating-database-indexes) for more detail. | `[]`  | `{ "keys": { "username": 1 }, "options": { "unique": true } }`

> **Overriding configuration using querystring parameters**
>
> It is possible to override some of these values when requesting data from the endpoint, by using querystring parameters. See [Querying a collection](#querying) for detailed documentation.
>
> -- advice

### Collection configuration endpoints

Every collection in your API has an additional configuration route available. To use it, append `/config` to one of your collection endpoints, for example: https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/libray/books/config.

Making a GET request to the collection's configuration endpoint returns the collection schema:

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/config HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 37f9786b-3f39-4c87-a8ff-9530efd176c3
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Connection: close
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 12639
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:05:44 GMT
Connection: close

{
  "fields": {
    "published": {
      "type": "Object",
      "label": "Published State",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "settings": {
  }
}
```

## The REST API

The primary way of interacting with DADI API is via REST endpoints that are automatically generated for each of the [collections](#collections) added to the application. Each REST endpoint allows you to insert, update, delete and query data stored in the underlying database.

### REST endpoint format

`http(s)://api.somedomain.tech/{version}/{database}/{collection name}`

The REST endpoints follow the above format, where `{version}` is the current version of the API collections (not the installed version of API), `{database}` is the database that holds the specified collection and `{collection name}` is the actual collection to interact with. See [Collections directory](#collections-directory) for more detail.

Example endpoints for each of the supported HTTP verbs:

```
# Insert documents
POST /1.0/my-database/my-collection

# Update documents
PUT /1.0/my-database/my-collection

# Delete documents
DELETE /1.0/my-database/my-collection

# Get documents
GET /1.0/my-database/my-collection
```

### Content-type header

In almost all cases, the `Content-Type` header should be `application/json`. API contains some internal endpoints which allow `text/plain` but for all interaction using the above endpoints you should use `application/json`.

### Authorization header

Unless a collection has authentication disabled, every request using the above REST endpoints will require an Authorization header containing an access token. See [Obtaining an Access Token](#obtaining-an-access-token) for more detail.

## Working with data

### Retrieving data

Sending a request using the `GET` method instructs API to find and retrieve all documents that match a certain criteria.

There are two types of retrieval operation: one where a single document is to be retrieved and its identifier is known; and the other where one or many documents matching a query should be retrieved.

#### Retrieve a single resource by ID

To retrieve a document with a known identifier, add the identifier to the REST endpoint for the collection.

##### Request

**Format:** `GET http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books/{ID}`

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/560a44b33a4d7de29f168ce4 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
```

Retrieves the document with the identifier of `{ID}` from the specified collection (in this example `books`).

#### Retrieve all documents matching a query

Useful for retrieving multiple documents that have a common property or share a pattern. Include the query in the querystring using the `filter` parameter.

##### Request

**Format:** `GET http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books?filter={QUERY}`

```http
GET /1.0/library/books?filter={"title":{"$regex":"the"}} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
```

#### Query options

When querying a collection, the following options can be supplied as URL parameters:

| Property | Description | Default | Example
|:--|:--|:--|:--
| `compose` | Whether to resolve referenced documents (see the possible values of the [`compose` parameter](#enabling-composition)) | The value of `settings.compose` in the collection schema | `compose=true`
| `count` | The maximum number of documents to be retrieved in one page | The value of `settings.count` in the collection schema | `count=30`
| `fields` | The list of fields to include or exclude from the response. Takes an object mapping field names to either `1` or `0`, which will include or exclude the field, respectively. | The value of `settings.compose` in the collection schema | `fields={"first_name":1,"l_name":1}`
| `filter` | A query to filter results by. See [filtering documents](#filtering-documents) for more detail. | The value of `settings.compose` in the collection schema | `fields={"first_name":1,"l_name":1}`
| `includeHistory` | Whether to resolve history documents | `false` | `includeHistory=true`
| `page` | The number of the page of results to retrieve | `1`  | `page=3`
| `sort` | The sort direction to sort results by, mapping field names to either `1` or `0`, which will sort results by that field in ascending or descending order, respectively | The value of `settings.sortOrder` in the collection schema  | `sort={"first_name":1}`

#### Filtering documents

DADI API uses a MongoDB-style format for querying objects, introducing a series of operators that allow powerful queries to be assembled.

| Syntax | Description | Example
|:--|:--|:--
| `{field:value}` | Strict comparison. Matches documents where the value of `field` is exactly `value` | `{"first_name":"John"}`
| `{field:{"$regex": value}}` | Matches documents where the value of `field` matches a regular expression defined as `/value/i` | `{"first_name":{"$regex":John"}}`
| `{field:{"$in":[value1,value2]}}` | Matches documents where the value of `field` is one of `value1` and `value2` | `{"last_name":{"$in":["Doe","Spencer","Appleseed"]}}`
| `{field:{"$containsAny":[value1,value2]}}` | Matches documents where the value of `field` (an array) contains one of `value1` and `value2` | `{"tags":{"$containsAny":["dadi","dadi-api","restful"]}}`
| `{field:{"$gt": value}}` | Matches documents where the value of `field` is greater than `value` | `{"height":{"$gt":175}}`
| `{field:{"$lt": value}}` | Matches documents where the value of `field` is less than `value` | `{"weight":{"$lt":85}}`
| `{field:"$now"}`, `{field:{"$lt":"$now"}}`, etc. | **(DateTime fields only)** Matches documents comparing the value of `field` against the current date | `{"publishDate":{"$lt":"$now"}}`

### Inserting data

Inserting data involves sending a POST request to the endpoint for the collection that will store the data. If the data passes [validation rules](#validation) imposed by the collection, it is inserted into the collection with a set of internal fields added.

#### Request

**Format:** `POST http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books`

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "title": "The Old Man and the Sea"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    "_id": "5ae1b6464e0b766dd17dbab9"
    "_apiVersion": "1.0",
    "_createdAt": 1511875141,
    "_createdBy": "your-client-id",
    "_version": 1,
    "title": "The Old Man and the Sea"
  ]
}
```

#### Common validation errors

In addition to failures caused by validation rules in collection field specifications, you may also receive an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error if either required fields are missing or extra fields are sent that don't exist in the collection:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 681
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:21:04 GMT
Connection: close

{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "description",
      "message": "can't be blank"
    },
    {
      "field": "extra_field",
      "message": "doesn't exist in the collection schema"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Batch inserting documents

It is possible to insert multiple documents in a single POST request by sending an array to the endpoint:

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

[
  {
    "title": "The Old Man and the Sea"
  },
  {
    "title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls"
  }
]
```

### Updating data

Updating data with API involves sending a PUT request to the endpoint for the collection that holds the data.

There are two types of update operation: one where a single document is to be updated and its identifier is known; and the other where one or many documents matching a query should be updated.

In both cases, the request body must contain the required update specified as JSON.

If the data passes [validation rules](#validation) imposed by the collection, it is updated using the specified update, and the internal fields `_lastModifiedAt`, `_lastModifiedBy` and `_version` are updated.

#### Update an existing resource

To update a document with a known identifier, add the identifier to the REST endpoint for the collection.

##### Request

**Format:** `PUT http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books/{ID}`

```http
PUT /1.0/library/books/560a44b33a4d7de29f168ce4 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "update": {
    "title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls (Kindle Edition)"
  }
}
```

Updates the document with the identifier of `{ID}` in the specified collection (in this example `books`). Applies the values from the `update` block specified in the request body.

##### Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_apiVersion": "v1",
      "_createdAt": 1524741702962,
      "_createdBy": "testClient",
      "_history": [
        "5ae1b6c24e0b766dd17dbaba"
      ],
      "_id": "5ae1b6464e0b766dd17dbab9",
      "_lastModifiedAt": 1524741826339,
      "_lastModifiedBy": "testClient",
      "_version": 2,
      "title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls (Kindle Edition)"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "fields": {},
    "page": 1,
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

#### Update all documents matching a query

Useful for batch updating documents that have a common property. Include the query in the request body, along with the required update.

##### Request

**Format:** `PUT http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books`

```http
PUT /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "query": {
    "title": {
      "$regex": "the"
    }
  },
  "update": {
    "available": false
  }
}
```

Updates all documents that match the results of the `query` in the specified collection (in this example `"books"`). Applies the values from the `update` block specified in the request body.

##### Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_apiVersion": "v1",
      "_createdAt": 1524741702962,
      "_createdBy": "testClient",
      "_history": [
        "5ae1b6c24e0b766dd17dbaba"
      ],
      "_id": "5ae1b6464e0b766dd17dbab9",
      "_lastModifiedAt": 1524741826339,
      "_lastModifiedBy": "testClient",
      "_version": 2,
      "title": "For Whom the Bell Tolls (Kindle Edition)",
      "available": false
    },
    {
      "_apiVersion": "v1",
      "_createdAt": 1524741702962,
      "_createdBy": "testClient",
      "_history": [
        "5ae1b6c24e0b766dd17dbaba"
      ],
      "_id": "5ae1b6464e0b766dd17dbab8",
      "_lastModifiedAt": 1524741826339,
      "_lastModifiedBy": "testClient",
      "_version": 1,
      "title": "The Old Man and the Sea",
      "available": false
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "fields": {},
    "page": 1,
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 2,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

### Deleting data

Sending a request using the `DELETE` method instructs API to perform a delete operation on the documents that match the supplied parameters.

There are two types of delete operation: one where a single document is to be deleted and its identifier is known; and the other where one or many documents matching a query should be deleted.

#### Delete an existing resource

To delete a document with a known identifier, add the identifier to the REST endpoint for the collection.

##### Request

**Format:** `DELETE http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books/{ID}`

```http
DELETE /1.0/library/books/560a44b33a4d7de29f168ce4 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
```

Deletes the document with the identifier of `{ID}` from the specified collection (in this example `books`).

#### Delete all documents matching a query

Useful for batch deleting documents that have a common property. Include the query in the request body.

##### Request

**Format:** `DELETE http://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/library/books`

```http
DELETE /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "query": {
    "title": "The Old Man and the Sea"
  }
}
```

Deletes all documents that match the results of the `query` from the specified collection (in this example `books`).

#### DELETE Response

The response returned for a DELETE request depends on the configuration setting for `feedback`.

The default setting is `false`, in which case API returns an `HTTP 204 No Content` after a successful delete operation.

If the setting is `true` – that is, the main configuration file contains `"feedback": true` – then a JSON object similar to the following is returned:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Documents deleted successfully",
  "deletedCount": 1,
  "totalCount": 99
}
```

Where `deletedCount` is the number of documents deleted and `totalCount` the number of remaining documents in the collection.

> In versions of API prior to 3.0, only the `status` and `message` fields are returned in the response.
> -- warning

### Using models directly

When creating [custom JavaScript endpoints](#endpoints) or [collection hooks](#hooks) it may be useful to consume or create data, in which case it's possible to interact with the data model directly, as opposed to using the REST API, which would mean issuing an HTTP request.

The `@dadi/api` NPM module exports a factory function, named `Model`, which receives the name of the collection and returns a model instance with the following methods available.

- [count()](#count)
- [create()](#create)
- [createIndex()](#createindex)
- [delete()](#delete)
- [find()](#find)
- [get()](#get)
- [getIndexes()](#getindexes)
- [revisions()](#revisions)
- [stats()](#stats)
- [update()](#update)

> **Note**
>
> API 3.1 introduced a new model API, using Promises instead of callbacks and a few other changes. The [legacy version](/api/3.0.0/#using-models-directly) is still supported, but it is now deprecated and developers are encouraged to update their code.

### Validation

Documents sent to the API with POST and PUT requests are validated at field level based on rules defined in the collection schema.

Several means of data validation are supported in API, including [type validation](#type-validation), [mandatory field validation](#mandatory-field-validation), [length validation](#length-validation) and [regular expression validation](#regular-expression-validation).

While API can return default error messages when data fails validation, it is possible to customise the error messages for each field individually. See [Error Messages](#error-messages) below for more detail.

#### Type Validation

A field can be validated by type. DADI API will check that the value supplied for the field is the correct type as specified in the schema. Only the following JavaScript primitives are considered for type validation: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`.

```json
"fields": {
  "title": {
    "type": "String",
    "message": "must be a string"
  }
}
```

#### Mandatory Field Validation

Fields can be made mandatory by setting their `required` property to `true`. DADI API will check that a value has been supplied for the field when creating new documents. Validation for update requests is more relaxed and mandatory fields are not validated as they would have already been populated with data when the document was first created.

```json
"fields": {
  "title": {
    "type": "String",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

#### Length Validation

A field's length can be controlled by using the `minLength` and `maxLength` properties within the `validation` block. Validation will fail if the length of the string is greater or less than the specified length limits.

```json
"fields": {
  "username": {
    "type": "String",
    "validation": {
      "maxLength": 16
    },
    "message": "is too long"
  },
  "password": {
    "type": "String",
    "validation": {
      "minLength": 6
    },
    "message": "is too short"
  }
}
```

#### Regular Expression Validation

A regular expression pattern can be specified for a field, which may help enforcing business rules.

```json
"fields": {
  "productCode": {
    "type": "String",
    "required": true,
    "validation": {
      "regex": {
        "pattern": "^A"
      }
    },
    "message": "must start with 'A'"
  }
}
```

#### Validation Response

If a document fails validation an errors collection will be returned with the reasons for validation failure.

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 681
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:21:04 GMT
Connection: close

{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "title",
      "message": "must contain uppercase letters only"
    },
    {
      "field": "description",
      "message": "can't be blank"
    },
    {
      "field": "start_date",
      "message": "is invalid"
    },
    {
      "field": "extra_field",
      "message": "doesn't exist in the collection schema"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Error Messages

A set of default error messages are returned for fields that fail validation. The table below lists the built-in error messages and their associated meaning.

Message       | Description
:--|:--
"is invalid" | The default message returned for a field that fails validation
"must be specified" | A `required` field has not been supplied
"can't be blank" | A `required` field has been supplied but with no value
"should match the pattern `^[A-Z]*$`" | The value does not match the configured regular expression

It is possible to supply a custom error message by specifying a `message` property in a field specification. For example:

```json
"fields": {
  "title": {
    "type": "String",
    "required": true,
    "example": "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin",
    "message": "must contain a value"
  }
}
```

## Searching data

In versions 4.1 and above, DADI API ships with the ability to add search to your document collections. The data connector used must support searching with the inclusion of a `search()` method. Currently this is only supported by the MongoDB connector `@dadi/api-mongodb`.

### Configuration

A `search` block must be added to the configuration file:

```json
"search": {
  "enabled": true,
  "minQueryLength": 3,
  "datastore": "@dadi/api-mongodb",
  "database": "search"
}
```


| Path | Description | Environment variable | Default | Format
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
| `enabled` | If true, API responds to collection /search endpoints and will index content | *N/A* | `false` | Boolean
| `minQueryLength` | Minimum search string length | *N/A* | `3` | Number
| `wordCollection` | The name of the datastore collection that will hold tokenized words | *N/A* | `words` | String
| `datastore` | The datastore module to use for storing and querying indexed documents | *N/A* | `@dadi/api-mongodb` | String
| `database` | The name of the database to use for storing and querying indexed documents | `DB_SEARCH_NAME` | `search` | String


### Running a query

Query an indexed collection by adding `/search` to the collection's endpoint and include a `q` parameter in the querystring:

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/search?q=wizard HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
```

A response is returned in the same format as when performing any other GET query:

**Response**


```json

  "results": [
    {
      "_apiVersion": "1.0",

  "metadata": {
    "search": "wizard",
    "limit": 40,
    "page": 1,
    "fields": {},
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 2,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

Field filters can be applied in the same way as collection filtering:

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/search?q=wizard&fields={"title": 1} HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
```

**Response**


```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "5b5f14c4894d81942cb24aaf",
      "title": "The Wizards of Once"
    },
    {
      "_id": "5b5f14c4894d81942cb24aacd",
      "title": "Off to Be the Wizard"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "search": "wizard",
    "limit": 40,
    "page": 1,
    "fields": {
      "title": 1
    },
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 2,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

### Indexing documents for search

To enable document indexing you must specify a `search` block for each field you'd like indexed within the collection schema, including the weight:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String",
      "label": "Title",
      "search": {
        "weight": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Weight**

This value is a multiplier applied to the final relevance index to boost a document's position in the results.

It allows a field to take further priority over other fields within a given document thus causing the document to return with a higher rank. 

For example if two documents contain the word "banana", one in the title and the other in another field, if a weight of 2 has been applied to the title field, the document with "banana" in the title will receive a higher rank.

#### Indexing all content

To start a background indexing process, send a POST request to the indexing endpoint. Ensure you have a valid bearer token in the Authorization header when making this request.

```http
POST /api/index HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjbGllbnRJZCI6InRlc3QiLCJhY2Nlc3NUeXBlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE1MzMwNTgwODMsImV4cCI6MTUzNDg1ODA4M30.xnM17sNEmVd1mO7azs0uVv1EIsVCX_rt6qCvyUtaf40
```

## Working with files

DADI API can easily be configured to accept file uploads, allowing you to store file-based content along with your text-based content.

API ships with a default media collection called `mediaStore` and a set of endpoints for generating signed URLs, uploading files and querying the media collection using the same functionality available for standard collections.


### Authentication

Media upload requests must be authenticated with a Bearer token supplied in an `Authorization` header along with the POST request. See the [Authentication](#authentication) section for details on obtaining an access token.

### Configuration

There is a default global configuration for media uploads. To override the global configuration, add a `media` block to the [main configuration file](#configuration):

```json
"media": {
  "storage": "disk",
  "basePath": "workspace/media",
  "pathFormat": "date",
  "tokenSecret": "d1ff1cult-w0nderland",
  "tokenExpiresIn": "1h"
}
```

|Property|Description|Default
|:--|:--|:---
|storage| The storage handler to use. Determines where file uploads are stored. Possible values: `"disk"`, `"s3"`| `"disk"`
|basePath| When `"disk"` storage is used, `basePath` is either an absolute path or a path  relative to the directory where the application is run. When `"s3"` storage is used, `basePath` is a directory relative to the S3 bucket root.  | `"workspace/media"`
|pathFormat| Determines the format for the generation of subdirectories to store uploads. Possible values: `"none"`, `"date"`, `"datetime"`, `"sha1/4"`, `"sha1/5"`, `"sha1/8"` | `"date"`|
|tokenSecret|The secret key used to sign and verify tokens when uploading media|`"catb0at-dr1zzle"`
|tokenExpiresIn|The duration a signed token is valid for. Expressed in seconds or a string describing a time span (https://github.com/zeit/ms). Eg: `60`, `"2 days"`, `"10h"`, `"7d"`|`"1h"`
|defaultBucket|The name of the default media bucket|`mediaStore`
|buckets|The names of media buckets to be used|`["mediaCollectionOne"]`

### Available path formats

The `pathFormat` property determines the directory structure that API will use when storing files. This allows splitting files across many directories rather than storing them all in one directory. While this [isn't a problem when using S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html), when using the local filesystem storing a large number of files in one directory could negatively affect performance.

| Format | Description | Example
|:--|:--|:---
|`"none"`| Doesn't create a directory structure, storing all uploads for a collection in a subdirectory of the `basePath` location |
|`"date"`| Creates a directory structure using parts derived from the current date | `2016/12/19/my-image.jpg`
|`"datetime"`| Creates a directory structure using parts derived from the current date and time | `2016/12/19/13/07/22/my-image.jpg`
|`"sha1/4"`| Splits SHA1 hash of the image's filename into 4 character chunks | `cb56/7524/77ca/e640/5f85/b131/872c/60d2/1b96/7c6a/my-image.jpg` |
|`"sha1/5"`| Splits SHA1 hash of the image's filename into 5 character chunks | `cb567/52477/cae64/05f85/b1318/72c60/d21b9/67c6a/my-image.jpg` |
|`"sha1/8"`| Splits SHA1 hash of the image's filename into 8 character chunks | `cb567524/77cae640/5f85b131/872c60d2/1b967c6a/my-image.jpg` |

### Configuring media collections

To override the name of the default media collection, add a configuration property for `defaultBucket`:

```json 
"media": {
  "defaultBucket": "myDefaultMediaCollection"
}
```

To add additional media collections, add a `buckets` property:

```json 
"media": {
  "buckets": ["myImageCollection", "myFileCollection"]
}
```

> **Media collection endpoints**
>
> When interacting with the default media collection, endpoints begin with `/media`. When interacting with an additional media collection, endpoints begin with `/media/<bucketName>`, for example `/media/myImageCollection`
> -- advice  

### Storage types 

API ships with two file storage handlers, one for storing files on the local filesystem and the other for storing files in an S3-compatible service such as Amazon S3 or Digital Ocean Spaces. If you need access to the files from another application, for example DADI CDN, we recommend using the S3 option.

#### File storage

The file storage handler saves uploaded files to the local filesystem, in the location specified by the `basePath` configuration property. `basePath` can be a path relative to the installation location of API or an absolute path. 

```json
"media": {
  "storage": "disk",
  "basePath": "workspace/media"
}
```

#### S3-compatible storage

The S3-compatible storage handler allows API to interact with services such as Amazon S3 and Digital Ocean Spaces.

If the S3 storage handler is used, an additional set of configuration properties are required as seen in the `s3` block below:

```json
"media": {
  "storage": "s3",
  "basePath": "uploads",
  "pathFormat": "date",
  "s3": {
    "accessKey": "<your-access-key>",
    "secretKey": "<your-secret-key>",
    "bucketName": "<your-bucket>",
    "region": "eu-west-1"
  }
}
```

If using Digital Ocean Spaces, you'll require an additonal "s3.endpoint" property which should be set to something like "nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com"

> **Security Note**
> 
> We don't recommend storing your S3 credentials in the configuration file. The `accessKey` and `secretKey` properties should instead be set as the environment variables `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY`.
> -- warning

### Querying media collections

Media collections can be queried in the same way as regular API collections. Send a GET request to a media endpoint with a `filter` parameter:

```http
GET /media/mediaStore?filter={"width": 150}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "results": [
    {
      "_createdAt": 1525677293872,
      "_id": "5aeffceda32a4d53f24c8bd5",
      "_version": 1,
      "contentLength": 47237,
      "fileName": "10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg",
      "height": 720,
      "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
      "path": "/media/2018/05/07/10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg",
      "width": 960
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "limit": 40,
    "page": 1,
    "fields": {},
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
```

To include only certain properties in the returned response, supply a `fields` parameter:

```http
GET /media/mediaStore?filter={"width": 150}&fields={"fileName": 1}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "5aeffceda32a4d53f24c8bd5",
      "fileName": "10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "limit": 40,
    "page": 1,
    "fields": {
      "fileName": 1
    },
    "offset": 0,
    "totalCount": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
```

The file itself can be downloaded by sending a GET request for the value of the `path` property. For example, given the following media document, a GET request can be made to `http://your-api-domain.com/media/2018/05/07/10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg`

```json
{
  "_createdAt": 1525677293872,
  "_id": "5aeffceda32a4d53f24c8bd5",
  "_version": 1,
  "contentLength": 47237,
  "fileName": "10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg",
  "height": 720,
  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
  "path": "/media/2018/05/07/10687215_10154599861380077_4088877300129205613_n.jpg",
  "width": 960
}
```

### Uploading a file

To upload a file send a `multipart/form-data` POST to the media collection's endpoint. On successful upload the file's metadata is returned as JSON, and includes an identifier that can be used to create a reference to the file from another collection.

#### Uploading a file with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 8df4a823-1e1e-4bc4-800c-97bb480ccbbe"
  -F "data=@/Users/userName/images/my-image.jpg" "http://api.somedomain.tech/media/upload"
```

#### Uploading a file with Node.js

```js
const FormData = require('form-data')
const config = require('@dadi/web').Config

let options = {
  host: config.get('api.host'),
  port: config.get('api.port'),
  path: '/media/upload',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer 8df4a823-1e1e-4bc4-800c-97bb480ccbbe', // can be generated using '@dadi/passport'
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
}

let uploadResult = ''
let filePath = '/Users/userName/images/my-image.jpg'

let form = new FormData()
form.append('file', fs.createReadStream(filePath))

form.submit(options, (err, response, body) => {
  if (err) return reject(err)

  response.on('data', (chunk) => {
    if (chunk) {
      uploadResult += chunk
    }
  })

  response.on('end', () => {
    console.log(uploadResult)
  })
})
```

#### Response

If successful, expect a response similar to the below examples.

##### Disk storage

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 305
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "results":[
    {
      "fileName": "my-image.jpg",
      "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080,
      "path": "/Users/userName/api/workspace/media/2016/12/19/my-image.jpg",
      "contentLength": 173685,
      "_createdAt": 1482124829485,
      "_createdBy": "your-client-key",
      "_version": 1,
      "_id": "58576e1d5dd9975624b0d92c"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### S3 storage

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 305
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "results":[
    {
      "fileName": "my-image.jpg",
      "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080,
      "path": "workspace/media/2016/12/19/my-image.jpg",
      "contentLength": 173685,
      "_createdAt": 1482124902978,
      "_createdBy": "your-client-key",
      "_version": 1,
      "_id": "58576e72bafa53b625aebd4f"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Filename clashes

If using the filesystem storage and the filename of a file being uploaded is the same as an existing file, the new file will have its name changed by adding the current timestamp:

* Existing filename: `my-image.jpg`
* New filename: `my-image-1480482847099.jpg`

### Referencing files from another collection

Once a file is uploaded, its identifier can be used to create a reference from another collection. For this example we have a collection called `books` with the following schema:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String",
      "required": true
    },
    "content": {
      "type": "String",
      "required": true
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "Reference",
      "settings": {
        "collection": "mediaStore"
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "cache": true,
    "count": 40,
    "compose": true,
    "sort": "title",
    "sortOrder": 1
  }
}
```

The `image` field is a Reference field which will lookup the default `mediaStore` collection to resolve the reference. Having uploaded an image file and received its metadata, we can now send a POST to the `books` collection with the image identifier.

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 8df4a823-1e1e-4bc4-800c-97bb480ccbbe

{
  "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  "content": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J. K. Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury.",
  "image": "58576e72bafa53b625aebd4f"
}
```

A subsequent GET request for this book would return a response such as:

```json
{
  "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  "content": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J. K. Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury.",
  "image": {
    "fileName":"my-image.jpg",
    "mimetype":"image/jpeg",
    "width":1920,
    "height":1080,
    "path":"workspace/media/2016/12/19/my-image.jpg",
    "contentLength":173685,
    "_createdAt":1482124902978,
    "_createdBy":"your-client-key",
    "_version":1,
    "_id":"58576e72bafa53b625aebd4f"
  }
}
```

### Pre-signed URLs

Pre-signed URLs are useful to allow your users or applications to be able to upload a file without requiring an access token. When you request a pre-signed URL, you must provide an access token (see [Authentication](#authentication)) and specify an expected filename and MIME type for the file to be uploaded. The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the duration specified in the main configuration file or passed in the request for the signed URL.


#### Configuration

```json
"media": {
  "enabled": true,
  "tokenSecret": "catbus-goat-omelette",
  "tokenExpiresIn": "10h"
}
```

#### Request a signed URL

To obtain a signed URL, send a POST request to the `/media/sign` endpoint. The body of the request should contain the filename and MIME type of the file to be uploaded:

```http
POST /media/sign HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 8df4a823-1e1e-4bc4-800c-97bb480ccbbe

{
  fileName: 'my-image.jpg',
  mimetype: 'image/jpeg'
}
```

API returns a response with a `url` property that contains the signed URL for uploading the specified file:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 305
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "url": "/media/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6ImltYWdlLmpwZyIsImlhdCI6MTUyNzU3MzMzMiwiZXhwIjoxNTI3NTc2OTMyfQ.9d9HI3gCOSeuNgkeepISvs2QSvfcpXSSRBeHa6qVsXA"
}
```

##### Override the expiry when requesting a signed URL

The globally-configured token expiry value can be overridden when requesting a signed URL by specifying a new expiry in the request to obtain the signed URL:

```http
POST /media/sign HTTP/1.1

{
  fileName: 'my-image.jpg',
  mimetype: 'image/jpeg',
  expiresIn: '15000' // value in seconds
}
```

#### Upload the file

With the signed URL obtained in the above step, a POST request can be sent to that URL with the file. See [Uploading a file](#uploading-a-file) for information regarding the upload process.

```http
POST /media/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6ImltYWdlLmpwZyIsImlhdCI6MTUyNzU3MzMzMiwiZXhwIjoxNTI3NTc2OTMyfQ.9d9HI3gCOSeuNgkeepISvs2QSvfcpXSSRBeHa6qVsXA HTTP/1.1
```

### Deleting media

To delete, send a DELETE request to a media collection specifying a media document's `_id` property in the URL.

If successful, a 200 response is returned (or a 204 if `feedback: false` is set in configuration):

```http
DELETE /media/5b10e5b76b600c760dc1cb93

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Document deleted successfully",
  "deleted": 1,
  "totalCount": 2
}
```

### Error messages

#### Signed URL token expired

If the token for a signed URL has expired, the following response will be returned:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 305
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "name": "TokenExpiredError",
  "message": "jwt expired",
  "expiredAt": "2018-05-29T05:59:17.000Z"
}
```

#### Invalid filename

If the filename of the uploaded file doesn't match that sent in the request to obtain the signed URL, API returns a 400 error:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 305
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "name": "Unexpected filename",
  "message": "Expected a file named 'my-image.jpg'"
}
```

#### Invalid MIME type

If the MIME type of the uploaded file doesn't match that sent in the request sent to obtain the signed URL, API returns a 400 error:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 305
Connection: keep-alive
  
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "name": "Unexpected mimetype",
  "message": "Expected a mimetype of 'image/jpeg'"
}
```

## Multiple languages

API supports multiple languages for documents with translations at a field level. Currently, fields of type `String` can be translatable.

### Configuration

By default, a single language is used by API. It can be configured via the `i18n.defaultLanguage` property, which takes an [ISO-639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), defaulting to `en` (English).

To support additional languages, add the ISO codes for the languages you wish to support to the `i18n.languages` configuration property, as an array. For example, to support French in Portuguese in addition to the default language, set `i18n.languages` to `['fr', 'pt']`.

*Example:*

```json
{
  "i18n": {
    "defaultLanguage": "en",
    "languages": ["fr", "pt"]
  }
}
```

### Creating multi-language documents

The name of a translated field is formed by concatenating the name of the raw field with the ISO code of the language, with a special character in the middle: `{NAME}:{LANGUAGE CODE}`. For example, `title:pt` is the Portuguese translation of the `title` field.

Note that the special character that glues the name of the field with the language code is configurable via the `i18n.fieldCharacter` property. The default is a colon (`:`).

To create a multi-language document, use the normal [collection endpoints](#inserting-data) and specify a value for each of the fields you wish to translate.

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "title": "The Little Prince",
  "title:pt": "O Principezinho",
  "title:fr": "Le Petit Prince",
  "author": "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"
}
```

>
> **Unconfigured languages**
>
> Inserting a document with a translated field for a language that is not configured in `i18n.languages` will be accepted and will not throw a validation error, but those values will not be returned in queries. This allows languages to be worked on before they are ready for public consumption.
>
> -- advice

### Querying multi-language documents

Clients may request the version of one or multiple documents for a specific language using the `lang` URL parameter, which must contain an ISO-639-1 code. When present, API will attempt to find a translation to that language for each field in the documents collected by the query. When one is found, the translation is used as the field value, otherwise the original value is picked.

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/58176e72bafa53b625aebd4f?lang=fr HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "_id": "58176e72bafa53b625aebd4f",
  "_i18n": {
    "title": "fr",
    "author": "en"
  },
  "title": "Le Petit Prince",
  "author": "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"
}
```

When requesting a specific language, an `_i18n` object is added to the response, indicating which language was used for each of the translatable fields. In the example above, we requested the French version of a document and the `title` field had a French translation, so that was used and reflected on `_i18n.title`. The `author` field had no French version, so the original value was used and `_i18n.author` contains the ISO code of the default language.

When a `lang` parameter is not present, the raw content of documents is returned, containing the original value and all the language variations of each translatable field. In this case, no `_i18n` field is added to the documents.

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/58176e72bafa53b625aebd4f HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer afd4368e-f312-4b14-bd93-30f35a4b4814
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.somedomain.tech

{
  "_id": "58176e72bafa53b625aebd4f",
  "title": "The Little Prince",
  "title:pt": "O Principezinho",
  "title:fr": "Le Petit Prince",
  "author": "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"
}
```

### Languages endpoint

## Creating Database Indexes

Indexes provide high performance read operations for frequently used queries and are fundamental in ensuring performance under load and at scale.

Database indexes can be automatically created for a collection by specifying the fields to be indexed in the `settings` block.
An index will be created on the collection using the fields specified in the `keys` property.

An index block such as `{ "keys": { "fieldName": 1 } }` will create an index for the field `fieldName` using an ascending order.
The order will be reversed if the `1` is replaced with `-1`. Specifying multiple fields will create a compound index.

```json
"settings": {
  "cache": true,
  "index": [
    {
      "keys": {
        "title": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Multiple indexes can be created for each collection, simply by adding more index blocks to the array for the `index` property.

### Index Options

Each index also accepts an `options` property. The options available for an index depend on the underlying data connector being used, so it's essential that you check the documentation for the data connector to determine what is possible. For example, the MongoDB data connector is capable of creating indexes with any of the options available in the MongoDB driver, such as specifying that an index be a unique index:

```json
"index": [
  {
    "keys": {
      "email": 1
    },
    "options": {
      "unique": true
    }
  }
]
```

## Document Revision History

### **settings.storeRevisions**

If `settings.storeRevisions` is **true**:

* a `revision collection` will automatically be generated in the database when the first document for the collection is created
* a `revision document` will be stored in the `revision collection` when a new document is created
* a `revision document` will be stored for each subsequent update to an existing document  
* each time a `revision document` is created, the `_id` of the `revision document` is pushed onto a `_history` array of the original document

### **settings.revisionCollection**

If `settings.revisionCollection` is specified, the collection's `revision collection` will be named according to the specified value, otherwise the collection's `revision collection` will take the form `{collection name}History`.

For example:

`db.books.find()`

Main document stored in the collection, with revisions referenced in the history array:

```json
{
  "_id": "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e5",
  "title": "War and Peace",
  "_history": [
    "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e6",
    "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e7"
  ]
}
```

`db.booksHistory.find()`

Two revision documents stored in the revision collection — one created at the same time as the original document was created, the second created after an update operation to change the value of `title`:

```json
{
  "_id": "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e6",
  "title": "Draft"
}

{
  "_id": "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e7",
  "title": "War and Peace",
  "_history": [
    "548efd7687fd8b50f3dca6e6"
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** DADI API does not add or update any date/time fields to indicate the order in which revision documents were created, nor does it perform any sort operations when returning a document's revision history. It is up to the API consumer to include appropriate date/time fields and perform sort operations on the returned revision collection.

## Document Composition

To reduce data duplication caused by embedding sub-documents, DADI API allows the use of *Reference* fields which can best be described as pointers to other documents, which could be in the same collection, another collection in the same database or a collection in a different database.

**Reference Field Settings**

| Property       | Description        |   Example
|:----------------|:-------------------|:-------
| collection | The name of the collection that holds the reference data. Can be omitted if the field references data in the same collection as the referring document, or if the field references documents from multiple collections. | `"people"`
| fields  | An array of fields to return for each referenced document.   | `["firstName", "lastName"]`
| strictCompose  | Whether to enable [strict composition](#strict-composition). Defaults to `false`.   | `true`

### A simple example

Consider the following two collections: `books` and `people`. `books` contains a *Reference* field `author` which is capable of loading documents from the `people` collection. By creating a `book` document and setting the `author` field to the `_id` value of a document from the `people` collection, API is able to resolve the reference and return the `author` as a subdocument within the response for a `books` query.

**Books `(collection.books.json)`**

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "Reference",
      "settings": {
        "collection": "people"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**People `(collection.people.json)`**

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "name": {
      "type": "String"
    }
  }
}
```

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{ "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls", "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a" }
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a"
      },
      "author": {
        "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a",
        "name": "Ernest Hemingway"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enabling composition

> **Note**
>
> By default, referenced documents will **not** be resolved and the raw document IDs will be shown in the response. This is by design, since resolving documents adds additional load to the processing of a request and therefore it's important that developers actively enable it only when necessary.
>
> -- warning

Composition is the feature that allows API to resolve referenced documents before the response is delivered to the consumer. It means transforming document IDs into the actual content of the documents being referenced, and it can take place recursively for any number of levels – e.g. `{"author": "X"}` resolves to a document from the `people` collection, which in its turn may resolve `{"country": "Y"}` to a document from the `countries` collection, and so on.

API will resolve a referenced document for a particular level if the referenced collection has `settings.compose: true` in its schema file *or* if there is a `compose` URL parameter that overrides that behaviour.

The value of `compose` can be:

- `false`: Stops any referenced documents from being resolved
- `true`: Resolves all referenced documents for the current level; behaviour for nested levels depends on the value of `settings.compose` of the respective collections
- a number (e.g. `compose=N`): Resolves all referenced documents for `N` number of levels, including the current one
- `all`: Resolves all referenced documents for all levels

### The `_composed` property

When a document ID is resolved into a referenced document, the raw value of the *Reference* field is added to a `_composed` internal property. This allows consumers to determine that the result of a given field differs from its actual internal representation, which can still be accessed via the `_composed` property, if needed.

### Referencing one or multiple documents

Reference fields can link to one or multiple documents, depending on whether the input data is an ID or an array of IDs. The input format is respected in the composed response.

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

[
  { "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls", "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a" },
  { "title": "Nightfall", "author": [ "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a", "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a" ] }
]
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a"
      },
      "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls",
      "author": {
        "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a",
        "name": "Ernest Hemingway"
      }
    },
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4d",
      "_composed": {
        "author": [
          "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a",
          "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a" 
        ]
      }
      "title": "Nightfall",
      "author": [
        {
          "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a",
          "name": "Jake Halpern"
        },
        {
          "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1b",
          "name": "Peter Kujawinski"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multi-collection references

Rather than referencing documents from a collection that is pre-defined in the `settings.collection` property of the field schema, a single field can reference documents from multiple collections. If the input data is an object (or array of objects) with a `_collection` and `_data` properties, then the corresponding values will be used to determine the collection and ID of each referenced document.

**Movies `(collection.movies.json)`**

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String"
    },
    "crew": {
      "type": "Reference"
    }
  }
}
```

**Directors `(collection.directors.json)`**, **Producers `(collection.producers.json)`** and **Writers `(collection.writers.json)`**:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "name": {
      "type": "String"
    }
  }
}
```

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/movies HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Casablanca",
  "crew": [
    {
      "_collection": "writers",
      "_data": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41"
    },
    {
      "_collection": "directors",
      "_data": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42"
    },
    {
      "_collection": "producers",
      "_data": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a1b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "crew": [
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43"
        ]
      },
      "_refCrew": {
        "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41": "writers",
        "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42": "directors",
        "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43": "producers"
      },
      "title": "Casablanca",
      "crew": [
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41",
          "name": "Julius J. Epstein"
        },
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "name": "Michael Curtiz"
        },
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43",
          "name": "Hal B. Wallis"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

Note the presence of `_refCrew` in the response. This is an internal field that maps document IDs to the names of the collections they belong to, as that information is not possible to extract from the resolved documents.

### Strict composition

When API composes a set of documents, it ignores any IDs that do not match a valid document and also removes duplicate IDs from the response, returning a single instance of the repeated document. For example:

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/movies HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Inception",
  "cast": [
    "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41", // ID does not exist
    "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
    "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42", // Duplicate ID
    "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43"
  ]
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a1b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "cast": [
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43"
        ]
      },
      "title": "Inception",
      "cast": [
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"
        },
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43",
          "name": "Ellen Page"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

This behaviour can be changed by setting `{"strictCompose": true}` in the `settings` block of the Reference field. This tells API to produce an exact mapping of the input object, leaving `null` in the place of document IDs that do not match any documents, and resolving duplicate IDs multiple times. Here's how the response for the request above would look like if `cast` had strict composition enabled.

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a1b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "cast": [
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a41",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43"
        ]
      },
      "title": "Inception",
      "cast": [
        null,
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"
        },
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a42",
          "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"
        },
        {
          "_id": "5ac16b70bd0d9b7724b24a43",
          "name": "Ellen Page"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

### Pre-composed documents

Setting the content of a Reference field to one or multiple document IDs is the simplest way of referencing documents, but it creates some complexity for consumer apps that wish to insert multiple levels of referenced documents.

For example, imagine that you want to create a book *and* its author. You would:

1. Create the author document
1. Grab the document ID from step 1 and add it to the `author` property of a new book
1. Create the book document

You can see how this would get increasingly complex if you wanted to insert more levels. To address that, and as an alternative to receiving just document IDs, API is capable of processing a pre-composed set of documents and figure out what to do with the data, including creating and updating documents, as well as populating Reference fields with the right document IDs.

#### Creating documents

When the content of a Reference field is an object *without* an ID, a corresponding document is created in the collection defined by the `settings.collection` property of the field schema. If an array is sent, multiple documents will be created.

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls",
    "author": { "name": "Ernest Hemingway" }
  },
  {
    "title": "Nightfall",
    "author": [
      { "name": "Jake Halpern" },
      { "name": "Peter Kujawinski" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a"
      },
      "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls",
      "author": {
        "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a",
        "name": "Ernest Hemingway"
      }
    },
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4d",
      "_composed": {
        "author": [
          "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a",
          "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1b"
        ]
      },
      "title": "Nightfall",
      "author": [
        {
          "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1a",
          "name": "Jake Halpern"
        },
        {
          "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d1b",
          "name": "Peter Kujawinski"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Updating documents

When the content of a Reference field is an object *with* an ID, API updates the document referenced by that ID with the new sub-document.

The example below creates a new book and sets an existing document (`560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a`) as its author, but it also makes an update to the referenced document – in this case, `name` is changed to `"Ernest Miller Hemingway"`.

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/books HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls",
    "author": {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a",
      "name": "Ernest Miller Hemingway"
    }
  }
]
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a3b68d4c",
      "_composed": {
        "author": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a"
      },
      "title": "For Whom The Bell Tolls",
      "author": {
        "_id": "560a5baf320039f7d6a78d4a",
        "name": "Ernest Miller Hemingway"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Multi-collection references

It's possible to insert pre-composed documents that use the multi-collection reference syntax, as long as the pre-composed documents are inside the `_data` property of the outermost object in the Reference field value.

The example below shows how the various scenarios can be mixed and matched: the first element of `crew` is a new document to be created in the `writers` collection (no ID); the second item is a document ID, which will be stored as is in the `directors` collection; the third item references an existing document from the `producers` collection, whose `name` will be updated to a new value.

**Request**

```http
POST /1.0/library/movies HTTP/1.1

          "name": "Hal Brent Wallis"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Limiting fields of referenced documents

When a reference is resolved, the entire referenced document will be included by default, but it's possible to limit the fields that will be included in the composed response. You can do this by specifying a `fields` array within the `settings` block of the *Reference* field's schema.

**Books `(collection.books.json)`**

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "Reference",
      "settings": {
        "collection": "people",
        "fields": ["firstName", "lastName"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify the fields to be retrieved for each *Reference* field using the `fields` URL parameter with dot-notation. The following request instructs API to get all books, limiting the fields returned to `title` and `author`, with the latter only showing the fields `name` and `occupation` from the referenced collection.

```http
GET /1.0/library/books?fields={"title":1,"author.name":1,"author.occupation":1} HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Collection Statistics

Collection statistics can be retrieved by sending a GET request to a collection's `/stats` endpoint:

```http
GET /1.0/library/books/stats HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

An example response when using the MongoDB data connector:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "size": 480,
  "averageObjectSize": 240,
  "storageSize": 8192,
  "indexes": 1,
  "totalIndexSize": 8176,
  "indexSizes": { "_id_": 8176 }
}
```


## Adding application logic

### Endpoints

DADI API custom endpoints give you the ability to modify, enrich and massage your data before it is returned to the user making the request. Collection endpoints return raw data in response to requests, whereas custom endpoints give you more control over what you return.

#### Endpoint Specification

Endpoint specifications are simply JavaScript files stored in your application's `/workspace/endpoints` folder. It is important to understand how the folder hierarchy in the endpoints folder affects the behaviour of your API.


```
my-api/
  workspace/
    collections/                    # MongoDB collection specifications
      1.0/                          # API version label
    endpoints/                      # Custom Javascript endpoints
      1.0/                          # API version label

```

#### Endpoint

Endpoint specifications exist as JavaScript files within a `version` folder as mentioned above. The naming convention for the collection specifications is `endpoint.<endpoint name>.js`

#### Endpoint URL

With the above folder and file hierarchy an endpoint's URL uses the following format:

`https://api.somedomain.tech/{version}/{endpoint name}`

In actual use this might look like the following:

`https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/booksByAuthor`

#### The Endpoint file

Endpoint specification files should export functions with lowercase names that correspond to the HTTP method that the function is designed to handle.

For example:

```js
module.exports.get = function (req, res, next) {

}

module.exports.post = function (req, res, next) {

}
```

Each function receives the following three arguments:

`(request, response, next)`

1. `request` is an instance of Node's [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
2. `response` is an instance of Node's [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse)
3. `next` is a function that can be passed an error or called if this endpoint has nothing to do.  Passing an error, e.g. `next(err)` will result in an HTTP 500 response. Calling `next()` will respond with an HTTP 404.

**Example, HTTP 200 response**

```js
module.exports.get = function (req, res, next) {
  let data = {
    results: [
      {
        title: 'Book One',
        author: 'Benjamin Franklin'
      }
    ]
  }

  res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json')
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.end(JSON.stringify(data))
}
```

**Example, HTTP 404 response**

```js
module.exports.get = function (req, res, next) {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json')
  res.statusCode = 404
  res.end()
}
```

**Example, HTTP 500 response**

```js
module.exports.get = function (req, res, next) {
  let error = {
    errors: [
      'An error occured while processing your request'
    ]
  }

  res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json')
  res.statusCode = 500
  res.end(JSON.stringify(error))
}
```

##### Custom Endpoint Routing

It is possible to override the default endpoint route by including a `config` function in the endpoint file. The function should return a `config` object with a `route` property. The value of this property will be used for the endpoint's route.

The following example returns a config object with a route that specifies an optional request parameter, `id`.

```js
module.exports.config = function () {
  return {
    route: '/1.0/books/:id([a-fA-F0-9]{24})?'
  }
}
```

This route will now respond to requests such as

```
https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/books/55bb8f688d76f74b1303a137
```

Without this custom route, the same could be achieved by requesting the default route with a querystring parameter.

```
https://api.somedomain.tech/1.0/books?id=55bb8f688d76f74b1303a137
```

#### Authentication

Authentication can be bypassed for your custom endpoint by adding the following to your endpoint file:

```js
module.exports.model = {}
module.exports.model.settings = { authenticate : false }
```


### Hooks

Hooks perform operations on data before/after GET, UPDATE and DELETE requests. In essence, a hook is simply a function that intercepts a document/query before it's executed, having the option to modify it before returning it back to the model.

#### Use cases

- Creating variations of a field, such as creating a slug (example above);
- Validating fields with complex conditions, when a regular expression might not be enough;
- Triggering an action, notification or external command when a record is modified.

#### Anatomy of a hook

A hook is stored as an individual file in a `hooks` directory (defaulting to `/workspace/hooks`) and can be used by being attached to `create`, `update` or `delete` operations in the `settings` section of a collection schema specification.

*collections.user.json*:

```
"settings": {
  "hooks": {
    "create": ["myhook1", "myhook2"]
  }
}
```

This means that whenever a new user is created, the document that is about to be inserted will be passed to `myhook1`, its return value will then be passed on to `myhook2` and so on. After all the hooks finish executing, the final document will be returned to the model to be inserted in the database.

The order in which hooks are executed is defined by the order of the items in the array.

The following example defines a very simple hook, which will change the `name` field of a document before returning it.

```js
module.exports = function (doc, type, data) {
  doc.name = 'Modified by the hook'

  return doc
}
```

This particular hook will receive a document, change a property (`name`) and return it back. So if attached to the `create` event, it will make all the created documents have `name` set to `Modified by the hook`.

However, this logic ties the hook to the schema — what happens if we want to modify a property other than `name`? Hooks are supposed to be able to add functionality to a document, and should be approached as interchangeable building blocks rather than pieces of functionality tightly coupled with a schema.

For that reason, developers might have the need to pass extra information to the hook — e.g. inform the hook the name of the properties that should be modified. As such, in addition to the syntax shown above for declaring a hook (an array of strings), an alternative one allows data to be passed through a `options` object.

```json
"settings": {
  "hooks": {
    "beforeCreate": [
      {
        "hook": "slugify",
        "options": {
          "from": "title",
          "to": "slug"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example we implement a hook that populates a field (`slug`) with a URL-friendly version of another field (`title`). The hook is created in such a way that the properties it reads from and writes to are dynamic, passed through as `from` and `to` from the `options` block. The `slugify` hook can then be written as follows:

```js
// Example hook: Creates a URL-friendly version (slug) of a field
function slugify(text) {
  return text.toString().toLowerCase()
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '')
    .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-')
    .replace(/^-+/, '')
    .replace(/-+$/, '')
}

module.exports = function (obj, type, data) {
  // We use the options object to know what field to use as the source
  // and what field to populate with the slug
  obj[data.options.to] = slugify(obj[data.options.from])
  return obj
}
```


#### *Before* and *After* Hooks

Different types of hooks are executed at different points in the lifecycle of a request. There are two main types of hooks:

- *Before* hooks: are always executed, fired just before the model processes the request and grabs the documents from the database. These hooks have the power to modify the query parameters, and therefore modify the set of documents that will be retrieved, as well as to abort an operation completely, if they choose to throw an error;
- *After* hooks: are executed only if the operation has been successful (i.e. no errors resulting from either *before* hooks or from the communication with the database). They are fired after the result set has been formed and delivered to the consumer. *Before* hooks cannot affect the result of a request. Typically used to trigger operations that must take place after a set of documents has been successfully created, updated or deleted.

These hook types are then applied to each of the CRUD operations (e.g. `beforeCreate`, `afterCreate`, etc.). If you think of API as an assembly line that processes requests and documents, this is where hooks would sit:

<pre>
         ______________          __________            _____________ 
Request |              |        |          | Response |             |
------> | beforeCreate | -----> | Database | -------> | afterCreate |
        |______________|        |__________|          |_____________|
</pre>

#### Types and signatures

Hooks are expected to export a function that receives three parameters:

1. The document or query being processed (type: `Object`)
1. The name of the hook type (type: `String`, example: `"beforeCreate"`)
1. An object with additional data that varies with each hook type (type: `Object`)

##### beforeCreate

Fires for `POST` requests, before documents are inserted into the database.

*Parameters:*

1. `documents`: An object or array of objects representing the documents about to be created
1. `type`: A string containing `"beforeCreate"`
1. `options`: An options object containing:
  - `collection`: name of the current collection

  - `req`: the instance of Node's [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
  - `schema`: the schema of the current collection

*Returns:*

The new set of documents to be inserted. An error can be thrown to abort the operation.

##### afterCreate

Fires for `POST` requests, if and after the documents have been successfully inserted.

*Parameters:*

1. `documents`: An object or array of objects representing the documents created
1. `type`: A string containing `"afterCreate"`
1. `options`: An options object containing:
  - `collection`: name of the current collection
  - `options`: options block from the hook definition in the collection schema

  - `deletedDocs`: an array containing the documents that are about to be deleted

*Returns:*

The new query to filter documents with. An error can be thrown to abort the operation.

##### afterDelete

Fires for `DELETE` requests, if and after the documents have been successfully deleted.

*Parameters:*

1. `query`: A query that was used to filter documents for deletion
1. `type`: A string containing `"afterDelete"`

*Parameters:*

1. `documents`: An object or array of objects representing the documents updated
1. `type`: A string containing `"afterUpdate"`
1. `options`: An options object containing:
  - `collection`: name of the current collection
  - `options`: options block from the hook definition in the collection schema
  - `schema`: the schema of the current collection

*Returns:*

N/A

#### Testing

The following hook may be useful to get a better idea of when exactly each hook type is fired and what data it receives, as it logs to the console its internals every time it gets called:

*workspace/hooks/showInfo.js*

```js
module.exports = function (obj, type, data) {
  console.log('')
  console.log('Hook type:', type)
  console.log('Payload:', obj)
  console.log('Additional data:', data)
  console.log('')

  return obj
}
```

And then enable it in a model:

*workspace/collections/vjoin/testdb/collection.users.json*

```js
"hooks": {
  "beforeCreate": ["showInfo"],
  "afterCreate": ["showInfo"],
  "beforeUpdate": ["showInfo"],
  "afterUpdate": ["showInfo"],
  "beforeDelete": ["showInfo"],
  "afterDelete": ["showInfo"]
}
```

## Internal Endpoints

### Hello

The *Hello* endpoint returns a plain text response with the string *Welcome to API* when a `GET` request is made to the `/hello` endpoint. It can be used to verify that DADI API is successfully installed and running. You should expect a 200 status code to be returned when requesting this endpoint.

### Configuration

The `/api/config` endpoint returns a JSON response with API's current configuration. This endpoint requires authentication by passing a Bearer token in the Authorization header. See the [Authentication](#authentication) section for more detail.

```http
GET /api/config HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

### Cache flush

Cached files can be flushed by sending a `POST` request to API's `/api/flush` endpoint. The request body must contain a path that matches a collection resource. For example, the following will flush all cache files that match the collection path `/1.0/library/books`.

```http
POST /api/flush HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{ "path": "/1.0/library/books" }
```

A successful cache flush returns a JSON response with a 200 status code:

```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "message": "Cache flush successful"
}
```

#### Flush all files

To flush all cache files from the API's caching layer, send `*` as the path in the request body:

```http
POST /api/flush HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{ "path": "*" }
```

### All Collections

The `/api/collections` endpoint returns a JSON response containing information about the available collections that can be queried.

```http
GET /api/collections HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "name": "books",
      "slug": "books",
      "version": "1.0",
      "database": "library",
      "path": "/1.0/library/books"
    },
    {
      "name": "user",
      "slug": "user",
      "version": "1.0",
      "database": "library",
      "path": "/1.0/library/users"
    },
    {
      "name": "author",
      "slug": "author",
      "version": "1.0",
      "database": "library",
      "path": "/1.0/library/authors"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Feature queries

As the feature set of DADI API evolves, it’s possible that two instances running different versions of the product have support for substantially different sets of functionality. Since consumer applications may require a specific feature in order to operate, it becomes essential that applications have a view on the capabilities of the API instance they communicate with. For security reasons, API does not expose its version number, but it does allow clients to inquire about whether a particular feature is supported.

Since version 4.2.0, every new major feature added to the product will be identified by a unique alphanumeric key. Consumer applications can use these keys to query an API instance about whether it supports a particular feature.

To use feature queries, add a `X-DADI-Requires` header to an API request and include a list of the features to query, separated by semicolons. The response will include a `X-DADI-Supports` header with the supported subset of the features requested. If none of the features are supported, the header will be omitted from the response.

In practice, this means that consumer applications can adapt to the capabilities of the API instance. For example, let's imagine that your application requires the feature set labeled with the key `aclv1`. You can send `X-DADI-Requires: aclv1` to API and look for a `X-DADI-Supports` header in the response – if it exists and it contains the value `aclv1` somewhere in it, you know the feature is supported. If not, you can make your application gracefully handle the incompatibility problem.

**Request**

```http
GET /1.0/library/movies HTTP/1.1
Host: api.somedomain.tech
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json
X-DADI-Requires: aclv1
```

**Response**

```json
Content-Type: application/json
X-DADI-Supports: aclv1

{
  "results": [
    {
      "_id": "560a5baf320039f1a1b68d4c",
      "title": "Casablanca"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Disabling feature queries

API will respond to feature queries by default. This behaviour can be changed by setting the `featureQuery.enabled` configuration property to `false`, which makes API ignore the `X-DADI-Supports` header completely.

>
> Note that consumer applications, such as [Publish](/publish), make use of API feature queries. Disabling them can cause these applications to stop working properly. Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing!
>
> -- warning

### Feature reference

The following table shows which features can be queried:

| Key | Description | Version added
|:--|:--|:--
| `aclv1` | Access control list including Clients API, Roles API and Resources API | 4.2.0
| `i18nv1` | Multi-language support | 4.2.1
| `i18nv1` | Multi-language support (with field character present in collections endpoint)| 4.2.2
| `collectionsv1` | Collections endpoint with information about schemas and settings | 4.2.2

## Data connectors reference

### MongoDB Connector

The MongoDB connector allows you to use MongoDB as the backend for API. It was extracted from API core as part of the 3.0.0 release. The connector is available as an NPM package, with full source code available on GitHub. Help improve the package at https://github.com/dadi/api-mongodb.


#### Installing

```console
$ npm install --save @dadi/api-mongodb
```

#### Configuring

As with any of the API data connectors, you need two configuration files. Details regarding the main configuration file can be found [elsewhere in this document](#configuration). Below are the configuration options for your MongoDB configuration file.

These parameters are defined in JSON files placed inside the `config/` directory, named as `mongodb.{ENVIRONMENT}.json`, where `{ENVIRONMENT}` is the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. In practice, this allows you to have different configuration parameters for when API is running in development, production and any staging, QA or anything in between.

Some configuration parameters also have corresponding environment variables, which will override whatever value is set in the configuration file.

The following table shows a list of all the available configuration parameters.

| Path | Description | Environment variable | Default | Format
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
| `env` | The applicaton environment | `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` or `development` or `test` or `qa`
| `hosts` | An array of MongoDB hosts to connect to. Each host entry must include a `host` and `port` as detailed below. | *N/A* | `` | Array

#### Using MongoLab

If you're unable to install MongoDB yourself, [MongoLab](https://mlab.com) provides a variety of plans to get you running with a MongoDB backend for API. They have a free Sandbox tier that is ideal to get a prototype online. Create an account at https://mlab.com/signup/, verify your email address, and we'll begin configuring API.

##### Create new deployment

Once your account is created with MongoLab you'll need to create a new "MongoDB Deployment". Follow the prompts to create a Sandbox deployment, then click Submit Order on the final screen to provision the service:

##### View MongoDB details

When the database is ready, click on its name to see the details required for connecting to it.

![](/assets/api/mlab/8.png)

##### Creating a MongoLab database user

MongoLab requires you to create a database user in order to connect:

> A database user is required to connect to this database. To create one now, visit the 'Users' tab and click the 'Add database user' button.

Complete the fields in the New User popup and keep a note of the username and password for the next step.

![](/assets/api/mlab/9.png)


##### Connecting from API

To connect to a MongoDB database you require two configuration files: the first is the main API configuration file (config.development.json) and the second is the configuration file for the MongoDB data connector (mongodb.development.json).

**config.development.json**

The key settings in the main API configuration file are `datastore`, `auth.datastore` and `auth.database`. When using the MongoDB data connector, `datastore` must be set to `"@dadi/api-mongodb"`. If using MongoDB for API's authentication data, `auth.datastore` must also be set to `"@dadi/api-mongodb"`. The `auth` section also specifies the database to use for authentication data; in the example below it is set to the name of the database we created when setting up the MongoLab database.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "name": "MongoLab Test"
  },
  "server": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3000
  },
  "publicUrl": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3000
  },
  "datastore": "@dadi/api-mongodb",
  "auth": {
    "tokenUrl": "/token",
    "tokenTtl": 18000,
    "clientCollection": "clientStore",
    "tokenCollection": "tokenStore",
    "datastore": "@dadi/api-mongodb",
    "database": "dadiapisandbox"
  },
  "paths": {
    "collections": "workspace/collections",
    "endpoints": "workspace/endpoints",
    "hooks": "workspace/hooks"
  }
}
```

**mongodb.development.json**

In addition to the main configuration file, API requires a configuration file specific to the data connector. The configuration file for the MongoDB connector must be located in the `config` directory along with the main configuration file. `mongodb.development.json` contains settings for connecting to a MongoDB database.

The database detail page on MongoLab shows a couple of ways to connect to your MongoLab database. We'll take some parameters from the "mongo shell" option and use them in our configuration file:

> To connect using the mongo shell:
> mongo ds159509.mlab.com:59509/dadiapisandbox -u <dbuser> -p <dbpassword>


```cson
{
  "hosts": [
    {
      "host": "ds159509.mlab.com",
      "port": 59509
    }
  ],
  "username": "dadiapi",  // username for database user created in MongoLab
  "password": "ipaidad",  // password for database user created in MongoLab
  "database": "dadiapisandbox",
  "ssl": false,
  "replicaSet": "",
  "databases": {
    "dadiapisandbox": {
      "authDatabase": "dadiapisandbox",  // the name of the database to use for authenticating, required when specifying a username and password
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "ds159509.mlab.com",
          "port": 59509
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Booting API

When you start your API application it will attempt to connect to the MongoLab database using the specified settings. 

```
$ npm start
```

After API finishes booting, you can click on the "Collections" tab in the MongoLab website and see the collections that API has created from your workspace collection schemas.

![](/assets/api/mlab/12.png)


##### Creating an API user

Before interacting with any of the API collections, it's useful to create a client record so you can obtain an access token. See the [Adding clients](#adding-clients) section for more details. After creating a client record you should be able to query the `clientStore` collection on the MongoLab website to see the new document.

![](/assets/api/mlab/11.png)

##### What's next?

With API connected and a client record added to the database, you can begin using the REST API to store and retrieve data. See the sections [Obtaining an Access Token](#obtaining-an-access-token) and [Retrieving data](#retrieving-data) for more detail.

The image below shows a "book" document added to the MongoLab database using the following requests:

```console
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" --data '{"clientId":"api-client", "secret": "client-secret"}' "http://127.0.0.1:3000/token"
```

```console
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 1e6624a9-324a-4d24-86c3-e4abd0921d9c"  --data '{"name":"Test Book", "authorId": "123456781234567812345678"}' "http://127.0.0.1:3000/vjoin/testdb/books"
```

### CouchDB Connector

The CouchDB connector allows you to use CouchDB as the backend for API.

Help improve the package at https://github.com/dadi/api-couchdb.

#### Installing

```console
$ npm install --save @dadi/api-couchdb
```

### FileStore Connector

The FileStore connector allows you to use JSON files as the backend for API, via [LokiJS](http://lokijs.org).

Help improve the package at https://github.com/dadi/api-filestore.

#### Installing

```console
$ npm install --save @dadi/api-filestore
```

### Building a connector

Sample repository at https://github.com/dadi/api-connector-template.

## How-to guides

### Migrating from version 3 to 4

#### Access control list

The main change from version 3 to 4 is the introduction of the [access control list](#access-control). It's technically a breaking change, since any clients without `{"accessType": "admin"}` will lose access to everything by default. They need to be assigned permissions for the individual resources they should be able to access, either directly or via roles.

If you don't want to use the new advanced permissions and instead keep your clients with unrestricted access to API resources, make sure to set `{"accessType": "admin"}` in their database records. API doesn't currently offer a way to change this property via the endpoints, so you'll need to manually make this change in the database.

#### Removal of write mode on configuraion endpoints

Version 4 removes the ability for clients to create, modify and delete collections, custom endpoints or update the main API configuration. The *read* endpoints were kept – e.g. `GET /api/config` is valid, but `POST /api/config` is not.

#### Other breaking changes

- Requesting a document by ID (e.g. `/version/database/collection/doc123456`) now returns a 404 if the given ID does not correspond to a valid document, instead of returning a 200 with an empty result set. This behaviour is consistent with the `DELETE` and `PUT` verbs.

### Connecting to API with API wrapper

When consuming data from DADI API programmatically from a JavaScript application, you can use [DADI API wrapper](https://github.com/dadi/api-wrapper) as a high-level API to build your requests, allowing you to abstract most of the formalities around building an HTTP request and setting the right headers for the content type and authentication.

In the example below, we can see how you could connect to an instance of DADI API and retrieve all the documents that match a certain query, which you can define using a [set of filters](https://github.com/dadi/api-wrapper#filters) that use a natural, conversational syntax.

```js
const DadiAPI = require('@dadi/api-wrapper')

let api = new DadiAPI({
  uri: 'https://api.somedomain.tech',
  port: 80,
  credentials: {
    clientId: 'johndoe',
    secret: 'f00b4r'
  },
  version: '1.0',
  database: 'my-db'
})

// Example: getting all documents where `name` contains "john" and age is greater than 18
api.in('users')
 .whereFieldContains('name', 'john')
 .whereFieldIsGreaterThan('age', 18)
 .find()
 .then(({metadata, results}) => {
   // Use documents here
   processData(results)
 })
```

For more information about API wrapper, including a comprehensive list of its filters and terminator functions, check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dadi/api-wrapper).

### Auto generate documentation

The `@dadi/apidoc` package provides a set of auto-generated documentation for your API installation, reading information from the collection schemas and custom endpoints to describe the available HTTP methods and parameters required to interact with the API.

* [Generating Code Snippets](#generating-code-snippets)
* [Documenting custom endpoints](#documenting-custom-endpoints)
* [Showing useful example values](#showing-useful-example-values)
* [Excluding Collections, Endpoints and Fields](#excluding-collections-endpoints-and-fields)

#### Installation steps

1. Inside your API installation directory, run the following:

```console
$ npm install @dadi/apidoc --save
```

2. The configuration file for API must be modified to enable the documentation middleware. Add an `apidoc` section to the configuration file:

```js
"apidoc": {
  "title": "<Project Name> Content API",
  "description": "This is the _Content API_ for [Example](http://www.example.com).",
  "markdown": false,
  "path": "docs",
  "generateCodeSnippets": false,
  "themeVariables": "default",
  "themeTemplate": "triple",
  "themeStyle": "default",
  "themeCondenseNav": true,
  "themeFullWidth": false
}
```

3. Initialise the middleware from the main API entry point (such as the `main.js` or `index.js` file:

```js
const server = require('@dadi/api')
const config = require('@dadi/api').Config
const log = require('@dadi/api').Log

server.start(function() {
  log.get().info('API Started')
})

// enable the documentation route
require('@dadi/apidoc').init(server, config)
```

#### Browse the documentation

The documentation can be accessed using the route `/api/1.0/docs`, for example `https://api.somedomain.tech/api/1.0/docs`.

#### Generating Code Snippets

If you want to generate code snippets (made possible by the configuration option
  `generateCodeSnippets`) you'll need to ensure sure your system has the following:

1. Ruby, and the Ruby gem `awesome_print`:

```console
$ gem install awesome_print
```

2. The `httpsnippet` package:

```console
$ npm install httpsnippet -g
```

#### Documenting custom endpoints

API collections are automatically documented using values from within the collection specification files. To have your documentation include useful information about custom endpoints, add [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments to the endpoint files:

````js
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 *
 * ```js
 * let result = add(1, 2);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {int} `num1` The first number.
 * @param {int} `num2` The second number.
 * @returns {int} The sum of the two numbers.
 * @api public
 */
````

#### Showing useful example values

To show example data in the documentation that isn't simply the default of "Hello World!", you can add properties to fields in the API collection specification file. The following properties can be added to fields:

**`example`**: the `example` property is a static value that will be the same every time you view the documentation:

```json
"platform": {
  "type": "String",
  "required": true,
  "example": "twitter",
  "validation": {
    "regex": {
      "pattern": "twitter|facebook|instagram"
    }
  }
}
```

**`testDataFormat`**: the `testDataFormat` property allows you to specify any type from the [faker](https://github.com/FotoVerite/Faker.js) package, which will insert a random value of the selected type each time the documentation is viewed:

```json
"email": {
  "type": "String",
  "required": true,
  "testDataFormat": "{{internet.email}}"
  "validation": {
    "regex": {
      "pattern": ".+@.+"
    }
  }
}
```

See a list of available options [here](https://github.com/FotoVerite/Faker.js).


#### Excluding collections, endpoints and fields

Often an API contains collections and collection fields that are meant for internal use and including them in the API documentation is undesirable.

To exclude collections and fields from your generated documentation, see the following sections.

##### Excluding collections

Add a `private` property to the collection specification's `settings` section:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String",
      "required": true
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "Reference",
      "settings": {
        "collection": "people"
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "cache": true,
    "count": 40,
    "sort": "title",
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "private": true
  }
}
```

##### Excluding endpoints

Add a `private` property to the endpoint file's `model.settings` section:

```js
module.exports.get = function (req, res, next) {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json')
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.end(JSON.stringify({message: 'Hello World'}))
}

module.exports.model = {
  "settings": {
    "cache": true,
    "authenticate": false,
    "private": true
  }
}
```

##### Excluding fields

Add a `private` property to the field specification:

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "String",
      "required": true
    },
    "internalId": {
      "type": "Number",
      "required": true,
      "private": true
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "cache": true,
    "count": 40,
    "sort": "title",
    "sortOrder": 1
  }
}
```

## Errors

### API-0001

#### Missing Index Key

You received an error similar to this:

```json
{
  "code": "API-0001",
  "title": "Missing Index Key",
  "details": "'name' is specified as the primary sort field, but is missing from the index key collection."
}
```

[TODO]

### API-0002

#### Hook Error

You received an error similar to this:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "API-0002",
      "title": "Hook Error",
      "details": "The hook 'myHook' failed: 'ReferenceError: title is not defined'"
    }
  ]
}
```

[TODO]

### API-0003

#### Cache Path Missing

To flush the cache, a path that matches a collection resource must be specified in the request body:

```http
POST /api/flush HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer 4172bbf1-0890-41c7-b0db-477095a288b6
Content-Type: application/json

{ "path": "/1.0/library/books" }
```

This command will flush all cache files that match the collection path specified.

A successful cache flush returns a HTTP 200 response:

```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "message": "Cache flush successful"
}
```

##### Flush all files

To flush all cache files, send `{ path: "*" }`

### Migrating from version 2.x to 3.x

API 3.0 comes with various performance and flexibility enhancements, some of which introduce breaking changes. This document is an overview of the changes that are required to make your application ready for the upgrade. 

#### Configuring a database and data connector

Whilst API 2.0 requires a MongoDB database to run, version 3.0 is capable of working with virtually any database engine, as long as there is a [data connector module](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=dadi-api-connector&page=1&ranking=optimal) for it.

When migrating from 2.0, we need to explicitly specify MongoDB as our database engine by adding `@dadi/api-mongodb` as a project dependency:
    
```bash
$ npm install @dadi/api-mongodb --save
```

API requires each data connector to have its own configuration file located in the same directory as API's main configuration files. Just like API, you'll need one for each environment you run the application in.

For example, if you currently have a `config.development.json` and `config.production.json` configuration files, you'll need to place `mongodb.development.json` and `mongodb.production.json` in the same directory.

```bash
api-app/
  config/              # contains environment-specific configuration files
    config.development.json
    config.production.json
    mongodb.development.json
    mongodb.production.json
  package.json
  workspace/
    collections/       
    endpoints/         
```

##### Automatic migration script

We've added a migration script which can backup your existing API 2.0 configuration files and generate new API 3.0-compatible files automatically.

To use it, run the following command from your existing API directory:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadi/registry/master/api/migration-scripts/v2-v3.js | node
```

##### Manual configuration

If you're configuring this manually, follow these steps:

1. Remove the contents of the `database` property from each of your API configuration files, and paste it into the corresponding MongoDB configuration file, so that it looks similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "123.456.78.9",
          "port": 27017
        }
      ],
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "testdb": {
        "hosts": [
          {
            "host": "111.222.33.4",
            "port": 27017
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2. Each block of database overrides should now be namespaced under a `databases` block. Using the above as our example, it should now be similar to the following. Notice how we've moved the `"testdb"` database configuration _inside_ the new `"databases"` block:
      

    ```json
    {
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "123.456.78.9",
          "port": 27017
        }
      ],
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "databases": {
        "testdb": {
          "hosts": [
            {
              "host": "111.222.33.4",
              "port": 27017
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. In the API configuration files, add a new property `"datastore"` where the `"database"` property was. It should have the value `"@dadi/api-mongodb"`:


    ```json
    {
      "server": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 8000
      },
      "datastore": "@dadi/api-mongodb",
      "caching": {
        
      }
    }
    ```

4. Your API configuration files should have an `"auth"` containing a `"database"` block. Change this to simply the name of the database you want to use for authentication, and add a `"datastore"` property with the value `"@dadi/api-mongodb"`.

    *Before (`config.development.json`)*
    
    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "tokenUrl": "/token",
        "tokenTtl": 1800,
        "clientCollection": "clientStore",
        "tokenCollection": "tokenStore",
        "database": {
          "hosts": [
            {
              "host": "127.0.0.1",
              "port": 27017
            }
          ],
          "username": "",
          "password": "",
          "database": "dadiapiauth"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *After (`config.development.json`)*
    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "tokenUrl": "/token",
        "tokenTtl": 1800,
        "clientCollection": "clientStore",
        "tokenCollection": "tokenStore",
        "datastore": "@dadi/api-mongodb",
        "database": "dadiapiauth"
      },
    }
    ```

5. If your chosen authentication database (e.g. `"dadiapiauth"`) has different hosts to the default you must  ensure an entry exists for it in the `"databases"` block in `mongodb.development.json`:

    *`mongodb.development.json`*
    ```json
    {
      "databases": {
        "dadiapiauth": {
          "hosts": [
            {
              "host": "222.333.44.5",
              "port": 27017
            }
          ]
        }
      }  
    }
    ```

#### What's next?

While the above configuration changes should be enough to get the application started, there are several more changes you should know about. They can be found in detail in the release notes for [API Vesion 3.0](https://github.com/dadi/api/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
