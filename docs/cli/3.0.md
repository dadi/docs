## Overview

DADI CLI is a command-line tool to help with the installation and customisation of the various products of the DADI platform.

### Programmatic vs. interactive mode

Each command requires its own set of parameters – for example, a command for installing a new version of DADI Web will need to know which template engines to install, whereas creating a new API client requires a client ID and a secret.

To provide an optimal experience for both programmatic uses, where a command is executed as part of an automated script, and for actual people running commands in their terminal, CLI applies this principle to every command: there is a flag accepted by the command for every parameter required, which when absent will be prompted to the user using an interactive mode.

## Requirements

- [npm 5.2.0](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) or later
- Node.js LTS

To install some DADI web services, you may also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine.

## Usage

Running `npx dadi-cli help` displays a usage summary:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli <command>

where <command> is one of:
  api clients:add      Creates a new client
  api new              Creates a new instance of DADI API
  api setup            Launches an interactive setup wizard

  cdn new              Creates a new instance of DADI CDN
  cdn setup            Launches an interactive setup wizard

  web new              Creates a new instance of DADI Web

--

Type npx dadi-cli help <command> to learn more about a specific command.
```

Commands begin with the name of the DADI application they apply to. For example, `npx dadi-cli api new` will install a new instance of API, whilst its CDN counterpart is `npx dadi-cli cdn new`.

### API commands

Running `npx dadi-cli help api` will show a list of all the API-related commands:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli api <command>

where <command> is one of:
  clients:add          Creates a new client
  new                  Creates a new instance of DADI API
  setup                Launches an interactive setup wizard

--

Type npx dadi-cli help api <command> to learn more about a specific command.
```

#### `api clients:add`

Running `npx dadi-cli help api clients:add` will show the following details for the command:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli api clients:add --id=<id> --secret=<secret>

Creates a new client

Available parameters:

id                     the client ID
secret                 the client secret
```

This command will create a new oAuth client. It requires two parameters: the client ID and secret, which can be passed using the `--id` and `--secret` flags or using the interactive mode.

#### `api new`

Running `npx dadi-cli help api new` will show the following details for the command:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli api new <directory> --version

Creates a new instance of DADI API

Available parameters:

directory              the name of the directory where DADI
                       API will be installed
version                the version of API to install
                       (defaults to latest)
```

This command will create a new instance of DADI API. If a `name` parameter is supplied, API will be installed in a subdirectory of the current directory, using the value supplied for `name`. If a `name` parameter is not supplied, API will be installed in the current directory.

In both cases, a warning will be shown when trying to install API on a non-empty directory.

```sh
? The target directory (/Users/johndoe/existing-directory) is not empty. Would you like to proceed? (y/N)
```

If the `version` parameter is supplied, its value defines the version of CDN that will be installed. If not, the latest available version is used. An error is shown when the value of `version` doesn’t match a valid version of CDN.

```sh
✖ 8.3 is not a valid version. Available versions: 1.5.x, 2.2.x
```

### CDN commands

Running `npx dadi-cli help cdn` will show a list of all the API-related commands:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli cdn <command>

where <command> is one of:
  new                  Creates a new instance of DADI CDN
  setup                Launches an interactive setup wizard

--

Type npx dadi-cli help cdn <command> to learn more about a specific command.

```

#### `cdn new`

Running `npx dadi-cli help cdn new` will show the following details for the command:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli cdn new <name> --skip-setup --version

Creates a new instance of DADI CDN

Available parameters:

name                   the name of the DADI CDN instance
skip-setup             skips the interactive setup guide
version                the version of CDN to install
                       (defaults to latest)
```

This command will create a new instance of DADI CDN. If a `name` parameter is supplied, CDN will be installed in a subdirectory of the current directory, using the value supplied for `name`. If a `name` parameter is not supplied, CDN will be installed in the current directory.

In both cases, a warning will be shown when trying to install CDN in a non-empty directory.

```sh
? The target directory (/Users/johndoe/existing-directory) is not empty. Would you like to proceed? (y/N)
```

If the `version` parameter is supplied, its value defines the version of CDN that will be installed. If not, the latest available version is used. An error is shown when the value of `version` doesn’t match a valid version of CDN.

By default, this command is succeeded by an interactive setup wizard, where the user is guided through a series of questions used to generate a configuration file. This step can be skipped by appending the `--skip-setup` parameter to the command.

#### `cdn setup`

This command will launch an interactive setup wizard, which guides users through a series of questions to form a configuration file.

It must be executed from a directory where an instance of DADI CDN is installed.

```sh

  ▓▓▓▓▓  ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
              ▓▓▓▓
     ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓    ▓▓▓▓
              ▓▓▓▓
          ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓


    DADI CDN setup

Let's start by configuring the web server that DADI CDN will run on. (0% complete)

? What is the name of this CDN instance? My new CDN
? What protocol should this CDN instance run on? HTTP (insecure)
? What is the IP address the application should run on? 0.0.0.0
? What is the port number the application should run on? 8080

Time to configure the sources that CDN will use to retrieve images. (18% complete)

? Would you like to load images from the local filesystem? (y/N)

```

### Web commands

Running `npx dadi-cli help web` will show a list of all the API-related commands:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli web <command>

where <command> is one of:
  new                  Creates a new instance of DADI Web

--

Type npx dadi-cli help web <command> to learn more about a specific command.
```

#### `web new`

Running `npx dadi-cli help web new` will show the following details for the command:

```sh
Usage: npx dadi-cli web new <name> --engine --version

Creates a new instance of DADI Web

Available parameters:

name                   the name of the DADI Web instance
engine                 name of a template engine interface
                       NPM module (for versions >= 3.x)
version                the version of Web to install
                       (defaults to latest)
```

This command will create a new instance of DADI Web. If a `name` parameter is supplied, Web will be installed in a subdirectory of the current directory, using the value supplied for `name`. If a `name` parameter is not supplied, Web will be installed in the current directory.

In both cases, a warning will be shown when trying to install Web in a non-empty directory.

```sh
? The target directory (/Users/johndoe/existing-directory) is not empty. Would you like to proceed? (y/N)
```

If the `version` parameter is supplied, its value defines the version of Web that will be installed. If not, the latest available version is used. An error is shown when the value of `version` doesn’t match a valid version of Web.

This command also allows users to choose which template engines they’d like to use with their instance of Web. The `--engine` parameter accepts a list of npm modules to use as engines.

The following command installs the latest version of Web on a subdirectory called `my-new-website` and installs the Dust.js and Pug.js template engines:

```sh
$ npx dadi-cli web new my-new-website --engine=@dadi/web-dustjs --engine=@dadi/web-pugjs
```

If this parameter is not supplied, CLI will go into interactive mode and ask the user to choose which engines to install from a list of available engines, pulled from NPM.
